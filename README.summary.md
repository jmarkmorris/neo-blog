# Summary of Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (NPQG)

This document summarizes the core ideas of Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (NPQG), a model aiming to provide a more fundamental and intuitive understanding of nature than current mainstream physics.

## Core Concepts

*   **Foundation:** The universe is based on a 3D Euclidean void with linear time, populated by two types of immutable point charges: electrinos (-e/6) and positrinos (+e/6).
*   **Emergence:** All phenomena, including spacetime, particles, and forces, emerge from the interactions and arrangements of these point charges.
*   **Noether Core:** A key structure is the Noether core, a stable configuration of three nested binaries (electrino-positrino pairs) that acts as an energy conservation engine.
*   **Spacetime Aether:** The "quantum vacuum" or "dark matter" is implemented by a sea of low-energy Noether cores, which also mediate gravity.
*   **Scale Invariance:** The model aims to be scale-invariant, meaning the same fundamental rules apply at all levels, from the smallest particles to the largest cosmic structures.

## Key Differences from Mainstream Physics

*   **Rejection of Singularities:** The immutability of point charges prevents singularities in black holes and other extreme environments.
*   **Local Expansion:** The expansion of the universe is reinterpreted as a local phenomenon driven by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies.
*   **Emphasis on Geometry:** The model emphasizes the geometrical arrangements of point charges and their interactions, rather than abstract mathematical constructs.
*   **Aether:** The model posits a physical aether, in contrast to interpretations of relativity that reject the need for such a medium.

## Implications and Applications

*   **Cosmology:** Offers a new perspective on the Big Bang, dark matter, and dark energy.
*   **Particle Physics:** Provides a potential framework for understanding the structure and properties of elementary particles.
*   **Technology:** Could lead to new technologies for energy generation, materials science, and computation.

# Gemini Assessment of "Dubiousity"

Based on the blog posts, the most dubious idea in NPQG, meaning the one that is most likely to be met with skepticism and resistance from the scientific community, is the claim that spacetime is a physical aether composed of point charge assemblies, and that this aether is what implements Einstein's curvy spacetime.

Here's why this is the most dubious:

- Clash with Established Physics: This directly challenges the established interpretation of General Relativity, which treats spacetime as a geometric entity rather than a physical medium.
- Lack of Direct Evidence: The point charge assemblies that make up the aether are proposed to be at the Planck scale, far beyond current experimental capabilities. This makes it difficult to directly verify their existence or properties.
- Historical Baggage: The concept of an aether has a long and troubled history in physics, having been discredited by the Michelson-Morley experiment. Reintroducing it, even in a modified form, requires overcoming significant resistance.
- Challenge to Foundational Principles: This idea challenges the foundational principles of both GR and QM, requiring a complete re-evaluation of many established concepts and mathematical frameworks.

While other aspects of NPQG, such as the immutability of point charges or the reinterpretation of dark matter, might also be met with skepticism, the claim about the aetherial nature of spacetime is the most radical departure from current scientific thinking and therefore the most likely to be considered dubious.
