# plan

- As of 2025, this github repo is the home of the neoclassical.ai blog.
    - This neo-blog is the official source of the neoclassical.ai blog content.
    - I plan to evolve the content with the help of Ai LLMs.

- The neoclassical.ai blog started on WordPress.com in 2018.
    - My WordPress subscription runs until 2028. 
    - I replicated the entire WordPress.com content to this github repo in 2025.
    - I have no plan to generate new content on WordPress.

- To Do list
    - Enhance the content! LLMs are improving in research and reasoning.
    - Continue towards textbook organization and style for learning.
    - Refresh posts to be engaging, professional, academic, and expert.
    - Make terminology consistent.
    - Reduce redundancy.
    - Consolidate related ideas in disparate threads.
