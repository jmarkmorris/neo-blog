The Michelson-Morley experiment was misinterpreted due to a faulty assumption.

> _The Michelson–Morley experiment was an attempt to detect the existence of the luminiferous aether, a supposed medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves. The experiment was performed in 1887 by American physicists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley._
> 
> _The experiment compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether ("aether wind"). The result was negative, in that Michelson and Morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles. **This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent aether theory**, as well as initiating a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which rules out a stationary aether. Of this experiment, Albert Einstein wrote, "If the Michelson–Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment, no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a (halfway) redemption."_

This experiment assumes certain characteristics of light and the aether that are incorrect. Let's examine the implementation of the photon and the aether to understand why these assumptions were false and led to an incorrect interpretation.

The photon is an assembly of twelve unit potential point charges. There are six orbiting binaries, all in a planar configuration perpendicular to the line of travel. The binaries are in nested groups of three. One group rotates clockwise, and the other counterclockwise. Through superposition, the potential fields cancel, and the remaining potential is measured as the standard electromagnetic field wave form.

With this understanding of the implementation of the photon, let's turn to the implementation of the spacetime aether. I imagine it as a dense soup of lightly interacting assemblies with extremely low apparent energy. I think those assemblies are the result of ultimately red-shifted photons and neutrinos that eventually lost their planar or nearly planar shape and puffed out as they lost energy. However, these assemblies have an extremely small volume. Photons pass right through or by them with an extremely small toll in redshift.

This spacetime aether picks up energy from nearby standard matter and this energy leads to an interaction with photons that can be modeled with permittivity and permeability. The energy gradient in the aether is the workhorse of gravity.

We see that the speed of a photon is actually variable depending on the local permittivity and permeability of the spacetime aether. The photon is self-propelling or sailing on its own potential fields emitted by the coaxial nested tri-binaries. Therefore, we now know that the photon speed in the Michelson-Morley experiment has nothing to do with the speed or direction of the emitting device and everything to do with the energy density of the local spacetime aether.

The bottom line is that the Michelson-Morley experiment makes an assumption about nature and then proves that assumption can not be true. However, the assumption is flawed and does not represent how nature actually works. Therefore, the experiment is a moot point and the interpretation that there is no aether is wrong.

Interestingly there are many aspects of GR/QM/LCDM era physics that suggest some kind of structure to spacetime. In fact entire sub-fields such as loop quantum gravity, string theory, and Bohmian mechanics are aimed at discovering that structure. Let's list a few specific facets of these theories that suggest some kind of an aether.

- The quantum vacuum that can freely produce pairs of standard matter particles, easily absorb reaction products, and facilitate the transmutation of standard matter particles from one kind to another.

- Dark matter

- Dark energy

- Inflation and expansion of spacetime

- Einstein's curvature of spacetime

Also, as I have mentioned modern science suggests that the universe has a flat geometry, which opens the door to a Euclidean void in time and space as the fundamental vessel of the universe. If that is true, then there must be an aether overlay that implements Einstein's curvy spacetime.
