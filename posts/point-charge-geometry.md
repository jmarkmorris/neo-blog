# _**Neoclassical.ai**_

Nature and the universe emerge from a dynamical geometry of equal and opposite point potentials in time and 3D space. **This geometrical adventure** presents a novel and elegant framework for understanding the emergent assembly that results in nature and the universe. It argues that the classical model of geometrical point charges (circa 1900) was too restrictive and overlooked a parsimonious and general geometrical point potential architecture. By redefining geometrical point charges in a more creative way as point potentials, we uncover a neoclassical assembly architecture for nature that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics and transforms the standard model of cosmology.

This chart shows the basic ingredients of the universe on the bottom row, and how those lead to emergent assemblies. Above that is the grand loop. Spacetime is formed from triply nested point potential binaries at different scales (frequency, velocity, orbital radius). The recycling is fed by extremely high energy Noether cores escaping out of a black hole (of sufficient conditions). From there we go through the big bang timeline, forming standard model particles, but according to a new point potential assembly architecture. Superposition leads to a shielding of energy and spacetime assemblies are almost totally cloaked. Reactions happen and we observe quarks, electrons, neutrinos, photons, W+/- and Z bosons, and the Higgs spacetime aether assemblies often are input reactants or products to a standard model transmutation reaction.

If the mention of shielding of energy by nested tri-binaries causes a comic light bulb to appear in your mind, then guess what, that is the dark energy and dark matter that scientists seek. You can pretty much explain all the open problems in physics and cosmology with reference to this chart and the differential to the standard model and LCDM. This new ontology makes quick work of the major problems in physics and cosmology.

Progressing upwards in the chart, begins a grand cycle of cycles where point potentials may experience highs and lows in energy (from 0 to Planck scale). There is a long-term trend towards the central SMBH in each galaxy, but an individual point potential may fly out of the galaxy or take a circuitous path over eons going who knows where.

At the top of the chart some of the matter-energy that enters a black hole may emit radially or via jets as extremely high energy spacetime assemblies. They are a cousin to the photon yet are capable of emitting through the photon event horizon. And the cycle goes on and on and on...

Let's recapitulate history, learn and explore the newly revealed ontology of nature, and map between **GR/QM/LCDM** and the **Point Potential Universe**.

**Themes, Major Insights, Philosophical Implications, "Laws"**

- Splitting the quantum (the idea that the quantum results from an orbiting positive and negative unit potential point potentials, i.e., a binary)

- The speed of the electric potential is the fundamental aspect that links space and time via the expanding Dirac potential spheres.

- Absolute relativity, since a point potential with velocity = 0 carries true meaning, as opposed to everything being relative. Zero means zero relative to Euclidean time and space as there is no path history nor Dirac sphere stream emanating from path history while at rest.

- The "aura" as a parsimonious term to encompass the dynamic scalar and vector potential at any point in time and space.

- The scientific method has failed in multiple ways for over 150 years and is in desperate need for updates from this era of debacle.

- Nature is, at the most fundamental, extremely simple, straightforward, and easy to understand. Scientists have simply been mixed up in how they understand nature. Now that we understand the source code and can model emergent complexity, the NPQG era begins.

Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (NPQG) is an architecture of nature and the universe based upon the most parsimonious physical foundation and ingredients imaginable, simple physical laws, and emergence.

- A density1 of equal and opposite, point potentials. These are named the electrino and the positrino for consistency with emerged composite structures the electron and the positron.

- A density2 of electromagnetic and kinetic energy carried by the point potentials.

- 1D linear time and 3D Euclidean space. Flat, not curvy space and forward moving linear time.

- Neoclassical mechanics — classical mechanics with no law that limits point potential speed.

NPQG explains the fundamental natural basis for **general relativity** and **quantum mechanics** and bridges these theories and their observations. NPQG reveals many new insights about nature and the universe as well as errors in the theory and narrative conception of GR/QM/LCDM.
