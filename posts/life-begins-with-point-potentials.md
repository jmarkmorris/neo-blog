We know that the point potentials, the electrino and the positrino, are necessary for nature, life, and the universe, because they are the only material elements in nature. Should they be considered as a precursor of life or as a life form in their own right? I'm going to make an argument that "**Life Begins with Point Potentials**". Of course, that statement begs the question of what do I mean by the concepts "life" and "begins". As of 2024, we do not have a complete ontology, taxonomy, and science around the concepts of "life" and how it emerged. Therefore, I make the case that point potentials are a primitive form of life, in fact the most primitive. It follows that everything is alive. This then requires that we expand our philosophy and science around the concept of life. Therefore, what I have stated is not controversial at all. I am suggesting that philosophers and scientists will need to recast their thinking in light of the point potential universe. It will be up to them to decide the consensus ontology around life. In this post, I will give my nascent view as a person with unique new perspective from the next era of fundamental nature.

**The Case for the Point Potential Being Considered a Form of Life.**

- Each point potential continuously emits potential at a constant rate.

- The potential emitted at any point (t,x,y,z) is defined by a Dirac delta magnitude which depends on the absolute velocity of the point potential.

- The potential emission is modeled as a Dirac sphere, a single pulse of potential that expands at the speed of potential, @.

- The surface integral of the potential of the Dirac sphere is constant regardless of radius r and is equal to the Dirac delta magnitude at r = 0.

- Each Dirac sphere expands forever with the Dirac sphere magnitude on a 1/r curve.

- Each point potential exists in the present moment in absolute forward moving linear time and 3D space.

- Each point potential is immutable and has no origin story or death story.

- Each point potential follows a path in response to all other point potentials and itself.

- Each point potential influences all other point potentials and sometimes itself.

Given those characteristics of a point potential, we can certainly say that each individual point potential is quite dynamic, influential, and responsive in their travels. For me, the clincher is that the point potential is constantly emitting new fresh potential, like a constant rate ideal geometrical point geyser that spews potential in beautiful spheres that expand forever.

**The primal emergent assembly is the binary.** **It is an evolution of life.**

- A binary is a coupling of an electrino and a positrino surfing in each other's potential wake and dynamically forming an orbit.

- An ideal binary is modeled as isolated in a Euclidean void of 3D space and forward moving linear time (modeled with R4).

- The ideal binary has a circular orbit.

- If we add or subtract energy to the binary, it adapts. The velocity of the point potentials increases which reduces the emission at each point along their path.

- Dynamically, the reduced emission travels to each partner, and causes its partners path to deviate from the perfect circular orbit.

- This is a dynamic feedback system. The feedback rings down (attenuates) provided the system remains stable.

- If the energy is not sufficient to cause a step change in radius, can it cause a phase change in the binary? i.e., adjust the phase of the orbit by a small amount to affect a phase change?

- If the energy is sufficient, it can cause a step change in radius. Addition (_subtraction_) of velocity reduces (_increases_) the starting magnitude of each Dirac sphere stream, which has proportionately factored into the action on each partner. Thus, the radius adjusts.

- When velocity reaches field speed the point potential is keeping up with its own emissions. If it were traveling in a straight line, it would build up an accumulation of 1/r sphere streams (which is sort of little tsunami I suppose). However, in a circular orbit, it's a bit more math. Other than that, the step to or from v = @ (field speed) can still cause radius to adjust.

- The revolutionary insight about the point potential binary occurs when v > @. This is the self-action regime and introduces a new action element, which is that each potential will experience self-action from its own path history. This self-action starts quite close and is tangential to the path, so it is much stronger than the partner action. The net effect seems to be that the radius deflates rapidly as energy is accumulated. Likewise, the radius inflates rapidly as velocity drops from pi @/2 to @.

Returning to the question of life, some point potential binary considerations are:

- the binary is emergent

- the binary has an origin in time

- the binary exists for some finite time

- the binary may decay at some point in time and cease to exist (the constituent point potentials continue on).

- the binary radius, frequency, and point potential velocity are dynamic with energy.

- the dynamic nature of the binary spans tens of orders of magnitude in both frequency and radius.

- the behaviour of the binary has limits, ranges, and a symmetry breaking point.

- there are two unique ranges of behaviour for the binary:
    - v <= @: partner action only,
    
    - v > @: self action in addition to partner action.

- the binary is a primary precursor to the next step in the tree of assembly and the tree of life.

**Emergence of Options, Decisions, and Implementation**

There is a very important step in the **ontology of life** in the point potential era. It is when an emergent assembly chooses between reaction options, i.e., makes a decision and the assembly structure reacts to accomplish that decision.

- Is this the stage where traditional scientists might define the origin of life?

- Is consciousness (no matter how primitive) required to make a decision and implement it?

I'm just planting a flag here for now. This seems like a fascinating area to explore. How specifically would some emergent assembly develop the capability or implement the process to choose between options?

The critical question is which assembly develops the ability to make a decision and now? One of the characteristics of the point potential universe is that there are so many possible reaction products for a given set of reactants. The provenance of the reaction depends on

- the energies and phases of every binary in every Noether core,

- the temperature of the weak personality charges,

- the "gravitational" field through the spacetime aether assemblies,

- the particular frequencies and paths of reactant photons.

- The statistical effects of low-level fluctuations in the incoming potential aura.

This step absolutely must happen. The big question is how.

While it is provocative to consider a point potential to be a primitive form of life, it is not an enormous stretch if one considers that the molecular components of RNA each contain between 4700 and 6400 point potentials in their assemblies. If we consider RNA essential to life (on Earth), and RNA is made of point potentials, it stands to reason that point potentials are a primitive life form as well.
