Nature is a tale of two closely related geometries. The fundamental geometry of nature is a Euclidean void of time and space that is the vessel for the universe. A second geometry, that of Einstein's spacetime, emerges and permeates the domain of geometry I.

Geometry I of the void is a Euclidean vector space with one-dimensional time and three-dimensional space, each continuous over the real numbers geometrically. This means that time and space are linear, i.e., flat. In the formulation of Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity, NPQG, I have presumed no functional capabilities of the void other than to serve as a vessel for energetic unit potential point charges and their potential fields. Let's discuss the characteristics of the void and its contents.

You can imagine the basis of nature and the universe with an extremely parsimonious set of geometrical objects with a precisely expressed action.

1. Absolute Time and Space (Geometry I)
    - Absolute time (Classical, Newtonian)
        - Linear
        
        - Real
        
        - Continuous
        
        - **_Now_** is synchronous across all space
        
        - Time moves forward
    
    - Absolute Space (Classical, Newtonian)
        - 3D
        
        - Euclidean
        
        - Real
        
        - Continuous
        
        - No coordinate system.
        
        - No orientation
        
        - No origin point.
        
        - No known bounds (beginning, end) in space, time, or potential.
        
        - Is neutral and has an inherent potential of zero everywhere.
        
        - Is a passive vessel for Dirac potential objects, as well as their superposition.
        
        - By leveraging the v=0 point potential definition, the void is considered to be a _**non-moving absolute frame of reference**._ This is the basis of _**absolute relativity**_.
    
    - Absolute time and space
        - Can be modeled with R4 (t,x,y,z)
        
        - Absolute time is defined in all space.

3. Dirac potential objects
    - Point Potential (Dirac)
        - Point potentials are geometric point objects that emit potential.
            - They have radius = 0
            
            - The concept of spin does not apply to individual point potentials.
        
        - Location in time and space (t,x,y,z)
        
        - Path history exists for all time prior to **_now_**
        
        - Magnitude |q|
        
        - There is no known speed limit for a linearly accelerated point potential
        
        - There are two point potential types {-|q| electrino, +|q| positrino}
        
        - Point potentials are constant rate emitters of potential dΦ /dt = q
        
        - Integration over the point emitter yields the product of
            - Dirac delta
            
            - \-|q| for the electrino or +|q| for the positrino
            
            - 1/|v|, for v > 0. i.e., the velocity modulates the constant rate emission.
        
        - The point potential definition is compatible with point potentials occupying the same location in time and space (t, x, y, z) although this would be difficult to maintain in practice.
        
        - A point potential with a velocity of zero, is at rest relative to the absolute frame of the void and casts no path history while at rest.
    
    - Potential Sphere (Dirac-like)
        - A point potential generates a continuous potential sphere stream.
        
        - Potential spheres continue expanding with time,
            - Where @ is the universal constant speed of potential emission
        
        - Given t = 0 at emission: x2 + y2 + z2 = @2t2 = r2
        
        - The integral over the sphere surface by time equals the emission at t = 0.
            - i.e., the potential on the sphere surface decreases by 1/r.
            
            - surface area = 4 pi r2
            
            - How does math work out?
        
        - A potential sphere contains the information about the radial direction to the point of emission, but not the distance or velocity since emission magnitude is modulated by velocity.
            - if the received potential is q/k, then the ideal fixed emitter is at r = k.
        
        - The only change to a potential sphere is continued constant rate expansion.
        
        - Point potentials can pass through sphere streams, moving towards or away from the point of emission.

5. Action
    - Action occurs when a potential sphere and a point potential intersect.
    
    - The intersecting potential sphere is determined by the path history of the emitter.
    
    - Intersection of a sphere and a point occurs on a radius from the point of emission.
    
    - Nature supports superposition of potential spheres.
        - Net action is the superposition of every individual action.
        
        - Any real action can be considered as a superposition of virtual actions
            - Any virtual action occurs on a virtual sphere radial to a virtual emitter.
            
            - The radial and transverse velocities of the receiver factors into action.
                - Equi-potential geodesics have radial velocity 0 and 1/r action.
                
                - Radial velocity towards or away from the emitter requires factoring velocity into the action.

7. Assumptions
    - The universe contains an equal large-scale density of electrinos and positrinos.
        - hence, at any given time t, the sum of all point potentials is zero and the sum of all potential sphere is zero.
    
    - There is a large-scale density of energy carried by point potentials, distributed equally between electrinos and positrinos.

9. Emergence
    - Assemblies of point potentials emerge with various lifetimes depending on their inherent stability, perturbations from other point potentials, or reactions.
    
    - The electrino:positrino binary is the primal assembly.
        - The binary is a dynamic system with feedback
        
        - A stable binary orbit exists at each integer frequency up to Fp.
            - The emission travel time t across a chord must equal the emitter travel time on the arc from the point of emission to the point of intersection with the partner's emission.
        
        - The symmetry breaking point in the binary is when v = @
        
        - Above v = @, self-action occurs for each point potential in the binary.
            - Note, for self-action, r = 0 occurs at the symmetry breaking point.
        
        - Self-action serves to change the dynamics and cause rapid deflation.
        
        - The curvature limit of the binary is reached when v = pi @ / 2.
        
        - Velocity, frequency, and orbital radius are related, causing the binary to operate as a variable length ruler (r) and a variable clock (f).
    
    - Binary assemblies are re-usable components, the primary one being the nested tri-binary, which is the basis for all assemblies, including every particle in the standard model and including Einstein's spacetime. (Geometry II)

11. Metrics
    - Prior to the emergence of the primal binary assembly, there is no measure of distance or time.
    
    - The primal binary assembly has an emergent limit on maximum curvature, establishing a distance standard.
    
    - The maximum frequency of a binary occurs at the maximum curvature, establishing a time standard.
    
    - Absolute velocity is defined.
        - A point potential with velocity = 0 for period T, emits a potential sphere stream with a constant form during the period T, from the position x,y,z.

13. Observations
    - The concepts of PE and KE may be emergent behaviours in the geometry of nature.
    
    - The universe at time t is described by the metrics of every point potential
        - (t, x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, q)

These are the fundamental entities in nature and the universe. Emergence does the rest.
