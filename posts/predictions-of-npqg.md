The scientific method espouses predictions that may be tested. These come in several categories that have differing weight.

1. A new prediction that diverges from existing theory and is then confirmed by experimental evidence carries the most weight.

3. A post-diction that explains existing experimental observations which had not yet been explained carries strong weight.

5. A post-diction that provides a superior reinterpretation of experimental observation carries medium weight.

7. A post-diction which reconfirms interpretation of experimental observation without adding new insight, carries the least weight.

In this post, I'll list a number of predictions of NPQG with commentary, including testability and post-diction potential.

| NPQG Prediction | Prediction Category | Commentary and Testability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| There are two fundamental equal and opposite geometric point potential types in nature, from which all other standard model 'particle/waves' are assembled. NPQG calls these electrino and positrino. | 1 | Direct measurement of these particles is well beyond the experimental capability circa 2020. Indirect support of this prediction is possible. |
| The electrino and positrino are conserved, indestructible, and immutable. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| The electrino has -1/6 charge and the positrino has +1/6 charge. | 1 |  |
| While it is possible to have an imbalance in electrinos and positrino count in a particle assembly, overall, the number of electrinos is equal to the number of positrinos in the universe. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| Spacetime is implemented by physical particle assemblies, made from point charges, that form an æther. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| The universe's background is an empty Euclidean void in 3D space and 1D time.   It does not curve or interact.   It is immutable.   It has no known beginning nor end in space nor time. | 4 | This can be inferred by a new understanding of how Einstein's curvy spacetime is implemented. Also, superluminal black hole jets provide indirect evidence. |
| Information is not preserved in a black hole that contains a maximally dense core. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| A black hole core may contain point potentials at maximum density, and the assemblies or plasma that is formed  may breach the event horizon of a black hole under sufficient conditions. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| A black hole core may breach the event horizon in a collision of a black hole and other high energy objects, such as black holes or neutron stars. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| There are no wormholes. | 1 | You can't test to prove a negative, but it is possible to create a complete theory that does not appeal to wormholes. |
| There is no singularity in a black hole. |  | This is already acknowledged by physicists, but they don't yet understand the internals of black holes. You can't test to prove a negative, but it is possible to create a complete theory that does not appeal to singularities. |
| The entropy of a maximally dense core is zero theoretically.   Presumably there are defects or lack of pure regularity in a maximally dense core. | 1 | Not observable. Supportable with theory only. |
| Energy is only carried by electrinos and positrinos.   Point charges carry electromagnetic potential and kinetic energy. | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
|  | 1 | Beyond 2020 scale of experimental testability. Indirect theoretical support of this prediction is possible. |
| The speed of light varies with the energy and the energy gradient of spacetime æther.   Spacetime æther can be described with the emergent characteristics permittivity and permeability. | 1 | Experimental validation is possible with a reinterpretation of astronomical observations. |
| Gravitational lensing is really refraction through variously energized spacetime æther around a massive object. | 1 | Experimental validation is possible with a reinterpretation of astronomical observations. |
| The universe is not expanding. Spacetime æther may flow locally. This may help explain the H0 tension. | 4 |  |
| A one-time inflationary Big Bang is not necessary to describe the universe. | 4 |  |
| The universe age is much greater than 13.8 billion years. | 4 | This fits much better with evidence from astronomical observation. |
| There are unaccounted forms of redshift and blueshift related to photon interaction with energy gradients in the spacetime æther. | 4 |  |
| All standard matter particles have a Noether core of 1, 2, or 3 electrino:positrino binaries.   The volumetric radius of Noether cores varies with energy according to the Lorentz equation. | 1 |  |
| Absolute time can not go backwards. | 1 |  |
| Noether cores and maximally dense cores can shield energy. | 1 |  |
| An ideal maximally dense core has one microstate. | 1 |  |
| Planck plasma jets emitting from a black hole can travel superluminally in regions where they have disintegrated intervening spacetime aether. | 4 | Already measured, but cause not attributed correctly in some observations. |
| Many reactions described in the PDG (particle data guide) do not account for all reactions. They are missing the spacetime aether particle inputs and outputs. | 4 |  |
| Noether cores come in pro and anti configurations.   There is no baryon asymmetry. | 4 |  |
| The collapse of the wave function in a particle assembly occurs when there is a quantized transfer of energy and a Noether core binary adjusts its radius accordingly. | 4 |  |
| Particle assemblies implement a wave function via the paths of the electrinos and positrinos in the particle shell. Wavelength is the linear distance traveled while the wave equation is traversed to a configuration symmetric with the starting point. | 4 |  |
| Standard matter assemblies interact with nearby spacetime aether assemblies. These interactions cause the spacetime aether to gain energy and to become more oblate.    | 1 |  |
| The CMB is simply red-shifted photons from high energy events some 13.8B years of photon travel time away. | 4 |  |
| The second law of thermodynamics can be rewritten as an equality when considering all particles, i.e., including spacetime æther. The total entropy of any reaction when accounting for all particles, including spacetime æther, is constant. | 4 |  |
| There are no magnetic monopoles to be found in nature. | 1 |  |
| Generation I fermions contain the shielded energy of generation II and III fermions.   Generation II fermions contain the shielded energy of generation III fermions. | 2 |  |
