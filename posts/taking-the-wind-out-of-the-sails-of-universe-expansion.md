I've understood the foundation, scaffolding, and structure for how nature and the universe work since mid-2018, and in the interim, with continued thinking and writing, the narrative and formulation of the theoretical solution continues to improve. The basic storyline of nature and the universe from first principles is simple and straightforward. Amusingly, this has made it challenging to engage physicists, because it is very difficult for them to leap over the chasm and let their minds engage with the new ideas that have far less foundational complexity than the leading edges of GR-QM era physics and cosmology. The top down method of the modern scientific method has led to increasingly detailed mathematical models of repeated patterns that are emergent from a foundation with minimal ingredients as mentioned in the intro above.

The universe is not expanding, but scientists think it is. There was no one time inflationary big bang, but scientists think there was. Instead, the way forward is to transform the current scientific conception into a process that is parallel, intermittent, and galaxy local. Parallelism is great. Nature is often parallel. While nature may have unique behaviours, especially at small scale, larger scale occurrences tend to be indiscernible patterns that are repeated elsewhere in the Universe.

As I have discussed many times on this blog, a galaxy central supermassive black hole can develop a Planck point charge core which under certain conditions can breach the event horizon at the poles and escape as Planck scale point charge plasma jets. Those jets will cool and react and one of the inflating products of the reactions is an enormous volume of spacetime æther which flows outward in each galaxy. As the spacetime æther is expanding from each galaxy, it eventually runs into the spacetime æther expansion from other galaxies. Statistically, the expansions from all the galaxies would tend to balance out, although certainly it is possible for large scale anisotropies to develop such as clusters and voids. Therefore we now understand that a photon traveling through and by galaxies will always experience expansion after expansion at slightly different rates. These galaxy local opposing expansions takes the wind right out of the sails of Universe expansion.

Here is an interesting video by Anton Petrov, where he discusses new findings on non-uniform expansion. Clearly the galaxy local inflationary mini-bang and expansion of NPQG is in a much better position to explain isotropy and non-uniform expansion than the one time inflationary Big Bang ΛCDM model. Enjoy!
