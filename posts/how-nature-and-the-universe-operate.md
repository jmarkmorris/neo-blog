1. Time and Space
    - The background of the universe is continuous 3D Euclidean space and linear time.
    
    - There is no known beginning or end in either time or space. 
    
    - Every absolute location can be labeled (t,x,y,z) and modeled with R4.
    
    - There is no defined origin of time or space.
        - We can reference some arbitrary zero in linear time,
        
        - We can reference an arbitrary 3D origin and absolute frame orientation.

3. The universe contains a density 1 of point potentials, carrying a density 2 of energy.

5. Each point potential emits a 'Dirac sphere stream' continuously along its path.
    - Emitters emit at a constant rate over time, regardless of their velocity or position. 
    
    - Each continuous potential sphere stream is centered on an absolute emission point (t,x,y,z) in the path history of the emitting point potential.
    
    - The magnitude of the potential sphere stream falls at 1/r.
    
    - The magnitude of the potential released per delta time to the Dirac sphere stream is dependent on the absolute velocity magnitude |v|
    
    - The magnitude of the potential on a particular Dirac sphere is initial potential divided by the surface area of the sphere which is 4 pi r2.
    
    - Note that when |v| >= @ it is still a Dirac sphere stream.
    
    - Potential spheres which inflate and expand as they cover the universe.
    
    - There is no point in the universe that is not covered at least once by the sphere stream from every point potential.
    
    - The continuously generating potential yields capacity for work and energy transfer.

7. Each point potential is a receiver of potential spheres and experiences action.
    - Consider a Dirac sphere received by a second point potential.
    
    - The receiver learns some information about the path of the emitter.  
    
    - The ray from the emission point is known from the propagation of the sphere stream.
    
    - The position on the ray has a range dependent on the emitter's velocity magnitude.
    
    - Each point potential in the universe is always experiencing action via intersection with the potential stream(s) of **every** point potential in the universe, including itself.

9. If a point potential is moving with |v| <= @
    - then it experiences the potential at r=0,
    
    - the Dirac sphere stream has no propagation direction
    
    - Hence there is no net action.
    
    - When an emitter is moving at c approaching @, the receiver gets very little indication of the approaching assembly.

11. If a point potential is moving with |v| > @
    - The point potential experiences its own past emissions.
    
    - This can get sort of confusing to think about because there are certain paths that lead to points (t,x,y,z) that are receiving potential from one or more points or segments of the path history of itself.
    
    - This dynamical geometry is mathematically unexplored for |v| > @.
    
    - When an emitter is moving at v >= @, the receiver gets no indication of the approaching assembly.

13. These operational characteristics lead to emergent formation of assemblies of point potentials. Some are relatively stable like spacetime and standard model particles.

One of the most fascinating, and historically confusing, assemblies is the spacetime assembly. The spacetime assembly provides the characteristics that Einstein described in special and general relativity. Spacetime assemblies are emitted from black holes under certain conditions. The emission may be via the polar jets or through the event horizon. Spacetime assemblies are extremely stealthy due to superposition and the orbital velocities of the constituent point potential binaries.

A particularly important emergent assembly is the photon, because the vast majority of scientific observations are made with photons (although recent multi-messenger astronomy has enabled observation through neutrinos and gravitational waves). The photon relies upon point potentials in its assembly constantly generating potential because the photon is almost certainly self-propelled! _Aside: Is the photon geometry and self-propulsion related to orbital velocities |v| > @?_

This post is a brief summary of the operational characteristics of our universe.
