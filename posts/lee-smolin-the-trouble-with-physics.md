Here is an interview of Lee Smolin, conducted by Brian Keating.

It is such a bummer these days for me to watch Brian Keating's channel. I invested a huge amount of time watching his episodes and in making intelligent comments on his channel relating the actual solution to nature to his discussions, and then eventually I called him up and he refused to talk to me!! He wouldn't let me get a word out of my mouth! I really don't understand what is wrong with physicists that can not be civil with independent ideators. I am also located in San Diego, so I was hoping to team up with UC San Diego so they could have the scoop on being the first to recognize my new solution, which is really just a refurbished idea from the physics discard pile. Brian put the kibosh on that. Bottom line, I know how nature works, its simple, physics discarded the idea, and the reason they are so lost is that they have now built up a large set of prior interpretations that are just plain nonsense.

I really like Lee Smolin and he is so close to the solution, yet so far away. He has some of the greatest insight, yet he is also lost in the complexity and abstractions of modern day GR-QM-LCDM such that he simply can't imagine a simple solution.

A lot of what Lee says is correct. The universe does 'emerge' in a sense from black holes, or at least they are the bounce point or recycle point at the high energy limit of nature. Spacetime is emergent. Time is emergent. Angular momentum is even emergent. The solution is so amazingly simple that scientists won't even give it the time of day.

Do you want to know the solution to nature? Just pick up point charges from the discard pile, dust them off, and model them with a field effect that gives them volumetric immutability at around a radius of the Planck length. Do you see what that does immediately? That means there is a maximum density of point charges. What does that mean? Yep, no singularity, no wormholes, no UV catastrophe, no renormalization, etc and etc. All kinds of problems in modern physics math just go away. Ok, so now if your universe is simply a Euclidean time and space chock full of energy generating and carrying immutable point potentials at plus and minus |e/6| charge, then what? Well, note there are only two free parameters: the average density of point potentials and the average energy generated and carried by point charges. Averages over large scales. Two free parameters is a huge deal. The standard model has 30 now (up from 26 a few years ago). All nature needs is TWO.

Let's call these point charges the electrino and the positrino, named after their standard model cousins the electron and the positron. But here's the next amazing thing nature does : it has a particle assembly architecture. Yep, all standard matter particles are based upon an amazing energy transacting and conserving structure made from orbiting electrino and positrino binaries. I call them a Noether energy conservation engine after Emmy Noether who did amazing work understanding how these gizmos operate without having any idea that they are the actual implementation.

A Generation I Noether energy engine has three coupled electrino:positrino binaries at significantly different energy scales (orders of magnitude) - it is a gyroscopic gimbal flywheel. All Generation I standard model fermions have one Generation I Noether engine. If CERN blasts away the low energy binary, you have a Gen II fermion. If CERN blasts away the two lowest energy binaries you have a Gen III fermion. Of course Gen II and Gen III don't live long because they don't have three degrees of stability and containment in our experimental conditions. Gen II and Gen III are only stable in high energy environments that can supply those additional dimensions of containment.

Moving on, each Noether engine can be decorated with a personality of point charges to make the neutrino, electron, up quark, down quark, and the anti counterparts. A neutrino has an assembly that oscillates such that it can no longer provide full shielding of the interior binaries, hence we see mass oscillation. A photon is just a Noether core coupled to an anti Noether core, with binaries planar to the line of travel, and the Noether engines slightly offset. So offset contra-rotating coaxial binaries -- see how polarization works? Malus' Law?
