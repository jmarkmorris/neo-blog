This post is in response to Kirsten's [article](https://kirstenhacker.wordpress.com/2019/10/16/black-hole-sun/) and video [Black Hole Sun](https://youtu.be/0RuauPVkyyY). 

\[01:22\] Thus begins an excellent discussion of the wavelength of a photon in a medium with an index of refraction. In NPQG, spacetime is implemented with an æther of particles and this æther has a permittivity and permeability that is related to the energy of the æther. These determine the speed of light in that medium as well as the wavelength (and frequency) of the light in that medium. Spacetime æther energy increases according to proximity and density of matter-energy. The net gradient of the spacetime æther energy around any particle is the gravitational vector around that particle.

Pause and think about the index of refraction in the context of NPQG spacetime æther. As every photon navigates the universe, it is constantly influenced by the instantaneous permittivity and permeability of the spacetime æther as it passes through. It might be miniscule fluctuations in refractive index in deep space or significant deviations in refractive index near a dense object where the gradient of spacetime æther temperature yields a strong gravitational field. Thus the photon's speed, wavelength, frequency, and direction are constantly shifting with no energy loss. A photon slowly loses energy as it passes through expanding spacetime æther local to each galaxy (which is in opposition to the expansions of neighbor galaxies). Exactly how does this work? Energy is conserved, so if photons lose energy then does spacetime æther gain energy? It must.

\[14:35\] Kirsten discusses a number of issues with simulation models and I agree with her concerns. However, if NPQG is correct, then at the most fundamental levels there is no such thing as analytical mathematical equations to fully describe nature at the smallest scales. Spacetime æther permeates everything and consists of incredibly small assemblies made from electrinos and positrinos point charges. If nature is truly discrete and particle based then techniques based on simulation would likely be the most accurate. However, the number of electrino and positrino particles that would need to be simulated would be so large that only very small systems could be simulated with the most massive parallel computers available as of this writing. Therefore it is still likely that higher level analytic models will continue to be used at their scales of applicability. A good example is the laws of thermodynamics that describe gases. Clearly gases are made from discrete particles, yet we can use equations to describe a sufficiently large system with accuracy and precision suitable for many applications.

Throughout the video Kirsten includes authoritative and factually supported criticisms of the way science has been conducted in the field of physics and cosmology since World War II. I largely agree with her assessments and the fresh angles she brings to this subject. There seems to be a growing number of authoritative physicists leveling critiques at the field and I certainly hope that this will lead to reform of the field sooner rather than later. I'm placing my hopes on NPQG as a solution that can potentially be the catalyst for a revolution.
