**The Joy of X** was a podcast hosted by mathematician [Dr. Steven Strogatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Strogatz) and sponsored by Quanta Magazine. Steven had a discussion with black hole scientist [Dr. Priya Natarajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyamvada_Natarajan) on his January 22, 2020 [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joy-of-x/id1495067186). I'll make a few comments on how Priya's work relates to NPQG. (_Aside : The podcast was relaunched as The Joy of Why which I think is a far superior title._)

Priya's doctoral work at Cambridge with Dr. Martin Rees in the late 1990s was on "_how to integrate the growth, formation, and evolution of black holes into the larger picture of assembly of galaxies and structure in the universe_". At that time Priya notes that **a very good theory already existed** on 'assembly of galaxies and structure in the universe' and that it was just beginning to be realized that each galaxy had a supermassive black hole in the center. The approach that Priya took was to presume the supermassive black holes fit into the existing theory.

I think a better approach would have been to set aside the existing theory as a reference model in its domain of applicability and start over with a clean slate. In NPQG there is no one-time inflation and big bang — these are distributed, intermittent, galaxy-local processes. The supermassive black holes are the primary recycling furnaces that consume matter-energy, which under certain conditions can form a Planck core of immutable electrino and positrino point charges, and under certain other conditions the Planck core can breach the event horizon at the poles, jetting point charge plasma which inflates and generally follows the timeline attributed to the big bang. However rather than a single event, this is an irregular periodic event for each SMBH in each galaxy. Isotropy in the universe occurs because all of the SMBH are following the exact same physics.

The golden age of black hole science is considered to be from the late 1950's to the early 1970's. It is my view that Stephen Hawking and others did a great disservice by prematurely closing the field of black hole science to new research by declaring the primary principles inviolable, in particular that nothing can escape a black holes except for Hawking radiation. By the time of Priya's work in the late 1990's, with the core scientific principles of black holes considered established, there was apparently no realization that supermassive black holes could form Planck cores which could breach the event horizon. The choice not to revisit black hole science in the context of supermassive black holes is unfortunate. This is further compounded when one considers that Einstein's general relativity predicts a singularity in a black hole, which is commonly known as an indicator of an incomplete theory of general relativity as well as an indicator of our lack of knowledge of the science of the interior of black holes.

Let's review the GR-QM era understanding of black holes versus NPQG.

| GR-QM Era Black Holes | NPQG Black Holes |
| --- | --- |
| Only Hawking radiation escapes a black hole. | A Planck core can breach a black hole event horizon via polar jets or rupture in a collision.      Hawking radiation theory is not disputed yet it should be revisited in the context of point charges. |
| Internals of black holes are unknown and untestable. | The jets or rupture emissions and their characteristics and effects provide evidence that can help us understand the internals of black holes.      The apparent mass of a black hole is another potential observable clue. By their nature, black holes contain a tremendous amount of shielded energy. |
| Einstein's singularity is known to be unrealistic but no natural solution is proposed. | A Planck core can form from immutable electrinos and positrinos at the Planck energy, perhaps packed in some form of lattice that serves as the ultimate battery or capacitor. |
| Accretion disk flow influenced by magnetic fields is the source matter-energy for polar jets. | Some jets are driven by Planck scale point charge plasma escaping the event horizon at the poles during a Planck core breach.      It may be possible that accretion disk flow is also swept up into the jets. It may be possible that accretion disk flow can form a jet in the absence of a Planck plasma breach. |
| Black hole jets are not superluminal and the ones that look superluminal to our instruments are actually at narrow angles oriented towards our instruments. | Black hole jets are composed of Planck plasma which is piercing through spacetime æther. Spacetime æther permittivity and permeability are what determines the speed of light, which is the limit of photon assemblies. Point charges have unlimited velocity and if the spacetime æther is decayed in the most energetic portions of the jet, then those portions of the jet can be superluminal. |
| No acknowledgment of Arp and the Burbidge's ideas on baby galaxies at the terminii of black hole jets. | During a black hole jet event, the terminus of each jet is the location where matter-energy will pile up. It seems logical to consider that this matter-energy cluster can be a nursery for a new galaxy. |
| The mass of a black hole is determined by the accumulated matter-energy that has been ingested. | The matter-energy on the interior of a Planck core can not present as mass nor participate in gravity due to shielding by superposition. |

The Joy of X episode with Steven Strogatz and Priya Natarajan is definitely worth listening to as a representation of the history and state of the art of black hole science.
