In this post I'll discuss _**one-time**_ **Cosmic Inflation**. Alan Guth is generally credited as the pioneer of cosmic inflation theory. Dr. Guth proposed inflation as a prequel to the Big Bang which had assumed homogeneity.

> As a junior particle physicist, Dr. Guth developed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1979 at Cornell and gave his first seminar on the subject in January 1980. Moving on to Stanford University, Dr. Guth formally proposed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1981, the idea that the nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion that was driven by a positive vacuum energy density (negative vacuum pressure). The results of the WMAP mission in 2006 made the case for cosmic inflation very compelling.

> Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical inflaton scalar field that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations, and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place?

**The one-time cosmic inflation theory is wrong** because there was **no** one time Big Bang. If there was **no** one time Big Bang there was **no** one-time cosmic inflation. We need to reset our understanding of inflation and how it is implemented in our steady state universe.

Guth linked his inflation to a one-time event and process (but not one place). NPQG imagines a parallel set of asynchronous processes distributed in time and ongoing. It will be **obvious in hindsight**, but cosmic inflation theory and the Big Bang theory were both anthropocentric. As if _this_ cosmos was created for us!

Essentially Guth was very close to being correct and I don’t know if he currently supports the ‘one time’ interpretation. In any case, Guth’s inflationary theory easily integrates with NPQG and the immutable point charge universe. Here is how I imagine the negative pressure vortex event during an inflationary mini-bang. The point charges in a Planck core are packed at around 10\-35 meters center to center and it may be that lower energy aether is being drawn into close proximity of the core by the frame dragging effects.

Dr. Paul Sutter says that there is a real problem that inflation is trying to solve. View “**Ask a Spaceman, The Ultimate Guide to Cosmic Inflation** (Parts 1-4).” Paul also says that while one-time cosmic inflation theory lends itself to a set of predictions, it nevertheless has some weaknesses. Let’s study these topics and compare how NPQG performs.

### **Problems Solved By Inflation**

Inflation is proposed as an explanation for the large-scale structure of the cosmos. In particular, inflation provides a causal connection for the isotropy of the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)**. Sir Roger Penrose says scientists believe “the CMB is the flash of the Big Bang, cooled down by the expansion of the universe.” Scientists also believe that quantum fluctuations during early inflation lead to large scale structure of the universe.

### **Predictions Made By Inflation**

> Inflation predicts that the structures visible in the Universe today formed through the gravitational collapse of perturbations that were formed as quantum mechanical fluctuations in the inflationary epoch.
> 
>   
> Inflation predicts that the observed perturbations should be in thermal equilibrium with each other. This structure for the perturbations has been confirmed by the Planck spacecraft, WMAP spacecraft and other cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, and galaxy surveys.

Except if the Planck satellite observations were of the normal radiation at that distance in our steady state universe. Which it is.

### The Weaknesses And Failures of the One Time Inflationary Big Bang.

If you study the ideas below, somehow they were weaknesses of big bang theory turned into successes of inflation. It is quite bizarre considering both theories are off-kilter!

**The Horizon Problem** — Big Bang theory states cosmic microwave background is leftover light from the early universe that has redshifted by a factor of **_z = 1090_** on its way to our telescopes. Sky surveys of the cosmic microwave background show it to be isotropic (the same) to 1 part in 100000. How do we explain this isotropy for portions of the cosmos that are not in causal contact? This is called the "horizon problem" and inflation prior to the Big Bang has been proposed as the solution.

In NPQG there is _no need for causal connection_ of the universe where variation in the cosmic microwave background is 1 part in 100000. With galaxy-local mini-bangs and galaxy-local inflation, we have a Planck limits scale process, governed by the same physics, throughout the universe. **It is natural in NPQG to expect isotropy.**

**The Flatness Problem —** With Einstein’s spacetime geometry being curvy, it opens the door to the question of the state of universe curvature throughout time. Why is curvature of the cosmos near zero now? Dr. Sutter says if you work backwards the cosmos would need to be extremely flat at the time of the Big Bang. Who ordered that? Why zero?

**NPQG** has no such flatness issue since NPQG is based upon a 3D Euclidean time and space, which is perfectly geometrically flat. There is nothing to explain with NPQG, because flatness is the nature of space. In NPQG, it is the spacetime æther that implements curvature due to changing energy density, i.e., gravity, and now we can restart the scientific inquiry with regards to local, regional expansion or contraction or fluctuations.

**The Monopole Problem** — Dr. Sutter talks about how exotic the universe must be as it emerges at less than 10\-35 seconds old with incredibly high temperature, energy, and density. By exotic he means that the temperature, energy, and density is so many orders of magnitude greater than we can create in our highest energy experiments. It must be in a plasma of oppositely charged particles - specifically protons and electrons Sutter surmises. He's close, but it's the electrino and positrino point charges that compose the plasma.

_Aside: I wonder why no one ever imagines connecting the concept of black hole singularity to the big bang? Isn’t it obvious in retrospect? It’s as if scientists have dismissed this very apparent connection collectively, rather than recognize it and say “hold up” this is a sign we made a wrong turn! This is yet another flaw in the scientific method. The scientific method is not good at self corrections of the degree needed in particle physics and cosmology. p.s. I think Penrose is the closest at making the connection with his conformal cyclic cosmology, but he is completely lost in scale, considering CCC at the scale of the entire universe._

Which forces of nature are present at the Planck scale? When we talk about Planck particles in a Planck core, we need to emphasize that interior Planck particles are not participating in much of anything. They are maxed out on energy and so are their neighbors. The weak, strong, and gravitational forces are not present for interior Planck particles. What about surface Planck particles? They are free to react and shed energy. They participate in gravity and exert electromagnetic and kinetic forces.

The emergence from a Planck core is a routine feature of **NPQG**. Galaxy-local mini-bangs are a result of jets or ruptures of Planck plasma. How much more exotic do you want? The Planck scale electrino:positrino binary is the ultimate assembly which could exist at the Planck scale. All standard matter-energy assemblies, including the æther, descends from Planck energy point charges. It’s interesting to consider which structures emerge at or near Planck energy per point charge. Certainly the basic binary emerges, i.e., an electrino and positrino orbiting each other, which is the most primitive emergent structure. What about generation III Planck photons? Are they a thing? It may even be possible for single electrinos and single positrinos to be emitted. However, these are not magnetic monopoles. In NPQG, magnetism is an emergent force caused by moving charge. There is no magnetism without motion.

**The Inflaton Field Problem** — It is very clear to me that physicists have gone field-happy. It seems as if physicists think any problem can be resolved with a new field! Well the concept is good as an intellectual stepping stone, but the inflaton is far better described with the mathematics of the binaries that form Noether energy conservation cores.

**The Seeding of Galaxies** — If ever there was a looney tunes Schrödinger’s cat’s litter claim, this wins 1st place. Seriously? How the heck can the Big Bang / Inflation Theory claim they seed galaxies? Compare to NPQG where galaxy-local processes with common natural processes shape the universe. Galaxies are the dominant process _**at their scale**_ and need neither an assist from a Big Bang nor a one-time inflation_._ Also note that NPQG does not make any specific claims about whether the universe is infinite although it appears to be unknowable from observation. NPQG leaves open the question of the extent and geometry of the universe for further scientific inquiry. The NPQG model itself does not define the universe, whereas the Big Bang Inflation model is intimately wed to the geometry of a **_single_** expanding bubble of spacetime. This is an important distinction, because a theory with more degrees of freedom is also more parsimonious.

### **Sir Roger Penrose**

https://youtu.be/PAdh70yeLmM

Sir Roger Penrose candidly discusses concerns with inflation and how new theories attempt to resolve these tensions. Frankly, I do not see any such concerns or tensions with NPQG.

> _“The thing about the singularity, which means the Big Bang... well, singularity means where everything goes to infinity and your equations sort of give up on you... and you get them in black holes. But the thing about the singularity and the Big Bang and it’s a very, very special character, and this is a strange thing, which cosmologists don’t really come to terms with. And it has this character, that if you stretched it out, sort of uniformly, completely stretched it out, it would disappear.“_
> 
> Sir Roger Penrose

Sir Roger discusses the concept of singularity in the Big Bang and black holes, while he somehow maintains cognitive separation of these as two distinct phenomena that share the concept of a singularity. Sir Roger goes on to say that if you were to stretch out the singularity until it was completely uniform, it would disappear and that this characteristic drives most of physics today. He says that the stretched out singularity would represent the infinite future of the prior aeon.

**NPQG** can explain this very special characteristic. If the singularity was completely stretched out (if it were possible, which it is not) the singularity would become a surface-only strand, and this would enable time to restart for Planck core particles upon their first energy transaction. This would also make apparent some of the energy that had been shielded in interior Planck core particles so they may be accounted for as mass in the æther and participate in gravity. The natural process for this "stretching" of the singularity is supermassive black hole (SMBH) jets. We solve this in NPQG with a mathematical treatment to allow for mass-energy disappearance while time is stopped for Planck particles.

SUMMARY

Here is a summary comparison of the Big Bang-inflation model vs. galaxy local recycling.

| QUESTION/ISSUE | BIG BANG - INFLATION | GALAXY-LOCAL RECYCLING |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where did matter and energy come from? | Unknown | Matter-energy ingested by the black hole supplies the recycling process. Matter (point charges in particle assemblies) and energy are conserved.      Unknown if/how the universe began and where energetic point charges originated. |
| Why does this high energy event occur? | Unknown reason for occurrence when it did. The event is driven by negative gravity per Guth, aka negative vacuum pressure. | SMBH dynamics control the process of Planck particle emission. New research topic. |
| How many times has it occurred, will it occur? | Generally thought to be once, although there are bounce and aeon variants. | Ongoing and intermittent. |
| What is the age of the universe? | ~13.8 billion years.      This also gives rise to concepts of early times and late times, primordial and other such age/maturity terminology. | Unknown. This opens the door to a far older universe, possibly infinitely old. New research topic. |
| Degree of universe evolution over time. | Very significant evolution: See the timeline for inflation and the Big Bang. See theories for expansion. See discussion of curvature of the universe. See CMB theory. See interpretations of high redshift observations. | Each galaxy-local mini-bang inflation/expansion event is local to a small region of the universe but also releases neutrino and photon assemblies that can travel far from their originating galaxy. This opens the door to the idea of a steady-state recycling universe. There is an opportunity for new science to research any ebb and flow of the forms of matter-energy over time at a universe scale. |
| Does it help explain galaxy rotation curves? | No. | Yes. There are new SMBH dynamics that may help explain galaxy rotation curves. Matter-energy entering Planck core phase causes mass disappearance from the æther. Inflationary jets and ejecta decay may have an effect as well. |
| How is galaxy seeding explained? | Quantum fluctuations in the primordial soup. | The emission of Planck plasma via SMBH jets causes concentrated matter-energy reaction regions at the knots and termini of the jets. These may be the beginning of child galaxies. See the work of Arp and the Burbidge's regarding anomalous redshift of quasi stellar objects. |
| How is Flatness of the Universe explained? | No satisfactory explanation. | Time and Space are Euclidean, i.e., flat. Einstein's curvature of spacetime is implemented with point charge assembly structures of spacetime æther. |
| Is an inflaton field required? | Yes. | No. |
| How is the Horizon problem explained? (Causal connectedness of the CMB to near isotropy - 1 in 100000 variation). | Isotropy of the quantum soup prior to inflation. | Galaxy-local high energy recycling processes, governed by the same physics throughout the universe. Isotropy is natural given that every occurrence of a mini-bang/inflation event passes near or through the Planck core phase. |

### **Eternal Inflation**

Eternal inflation was developed by Andrei Linde as a fix and advancement of Guth's inflation theory. It fits well with the NPQG ideas regarding galaxy local processes.

> _According to eternal inflation, the inflationary phase of the universe's expansion lasts forever throughout most of the universe. Because the regions expand exponentially rapidly, most of the volume of the universe at any given time is inflating._

### **Conclusions And Takeaways**

A barrier to progress in cosmology is the incorrect interpretation of Universe-wide expansion. Spacetime is not expanding outwards! Spacetime aether expands in place as higher energy aether in galacting centers spreads out and dissipates through and near the galaxy. I suggest galaxy-local phenomena wherein matter-energy and spacetime aether recycle on a scale of a galaxy and galaxy cluster. This includes the recycling of the energy or matter of redshifting particles passing through or captured. The presumably dominant process creating the æther of spacetime particles is driven from the Planck plasma ejecta in jets or mini-bangs from galaxy center SMBH which is then reinforced by galaxy local emitting events such as stars and supernovae. As photons and neutrinos from the emission decay, cool, inflate, react, and redshift they form lesser energy photons, neutrinos, and eventually end up as spacetime aether detritus, thirsty for a drop of energy and a grand new adventure.

The science around the Big Bang and one-time inflation is generally good work, even if it was blinkered. It won't be difficult for scientists to reframe their theories, models, and measurements towards a galaxy-local process. Furthermore, scientists have a laboratory to observe the intermittent and ongoing **Planck plasma jets and galaxy-local bangs and galaxy-local inflation** events throughout the universe in active galactic nuclei (AGN) supermassive black holes (SMBH) and possibly other high energy objects and events.

NPQG solves the same problems as the Big Bang and one-time inflation theory. NPQG makes different predictions. NPQG has **none** of the weaknesses of the Big Bang and one-time inflation theories.

### Predictions And Hypotheses

- There was no big bang as conceived by GR/QM/LCDM era physicists.

- Since there was no big bang, there was no one-time cosmic inflation.

- The inflation concept can be repurposed to be galaxy-local, and it occurs in high energy events where Planck scale point charge plasma emerges as a powerful jet or bang. A typical source of inflation is an AGN SMBH.
