One of the many failures of imagination in GR/QM/LCDM physics is a vague understanding of how spacetime is created, constructed, participates in reactions, and is recycled. Cosmologists will say that spacetime was created in the Big Bang, but they still don't know from what spacetime is made. There is so much confusion tied up in spacetime, such as pair production and annihilation, quantum vacuum, gravity, inflation, and expansion, yet physicists have not yet realized that the SMBH in each galaxy (and maybe some BH and NS) are responsible for recycling standard matter and low energy spacetime into fresh high energy spacetime. Here are some thoughts and questions about how spacetime emission works in NPQG.

- Velocity
    - When SMBH/BH/NS emit spacetime assemblies, what is their velocity distribution?
    
    - Do spacetime assemblies launch as a "dark photon", a planar spacetime assembly?
    
    - What causes spacetime assembly group velocity to decrease?
    
    - Do spacetime assemblies redshift?
    
    - At low velocities spacetime assemblies normalize total energy by equalization
    
    - If or when spacetime group velocity is greater than @ then the receiver doesn't intersect its sphere stream until that spacetime assembly is well past.
        - In a sense, it doesn't really matter though. Everything is superposition.
        
        - We just need to calculate the sum of the path based action.
    
    - Does the Planck scale correspond to a Noether core with a binary where v = @?
        - That's an interesting idea to contemplate.
        
        - Is the true limit, the maximum curvature, below Planck scale?
        
        - An aspect of stealth is high velocity point potentials in the assembly.
            - Emission is attenuated by velocity
            
            - Perhaps all binaries in a spacetime Noether core have v > @?

- Volumetric Displacement
    - When a Noether core is following Fermi-Dirac statistics it excludes any other Noether core from a volume of 3D space.
    
    - The interactions between Noether cores are what determines displacement volume.
    
    - Imagine displacement as an oblate spheroid with rough shape determined by the orbital planes of the three binaries, their precession, and I presume, the outer, low energy binary radius
    
    - The displacement must map to general relativity.
    
    - Ultimately displacement is about paths of point potentials and the resulting action.
    
    - As group velocity of a Noether core increases it becomes increasingly planar.Â 
    
    - At some point it becomes a boson, because its volume displacement is zero or near zero.
    
    - The model reveals a transformation between fermion and boson.

- Noether core spin
    - Point potentials do not spin, They are modeled as radius = 0 entities.
    
    - Assemblies do have a spin characteristic.
    
    - Fermions have spin 1/2.
    
    - Spin is mapped to the precession of the orbital axes of the tri-binary Noether core.
    
    - That precession repeats every two cycles, thus spin 1/2.
    
    - As group velocity of a Noether core increases it becomes increasingly planar.
    
    - When the orbital axes converge, then the assembly becomes a spin 1 boson.

- Are the following a family of assemblies? They are very similar.
    - Spacetime assembly:
        - pro and anti Noether cores
        
        - volumetric displacement geometry
        
        - observes Pauli Exclusion Principle
        
        - Fermi-Dirac statistics
    
    - Photon:
        - pro and anti Noether cores
        
        - planar geometry
        
        - does not observe the Pauli Exclusion Principle
        
        - follows Bose-Einstein statistics
    
    - Neutrino
        - pro **or** anti Noether core
        
        - high energy personality potentials
        
        - a "wobbly" assembly with oscillating superposition

One of the reasons I like the point potential model is that it can rearrange the interpretations of GR/QM/LCDM, fill in missing gaps, and lead to new understanding of how nature works.
