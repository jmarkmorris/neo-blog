For quite some time I have been thinking that low apparent energy aether is generated from ultimately redshifted photons and neutrinos.

However, with the emerging understanding of the Higgs as a duo of nestled pro and anti Noether cores that reveals significant energy, I am revisiting my vision in this area.

Is the energy being attributed to Higgs coming from elsewhere in the reaction, such as the gen III binary in a top quark?

What is the rate of spontaneous decay into standard model assemblies as a function of environment? For example, how does low to intense gravity influence the decay of aether assemblies?

Are spacetime aether assemblies consumed by black holes? Do black holes create any kind of buffer zone that has low to zero density of spacetime aether assemblies?
