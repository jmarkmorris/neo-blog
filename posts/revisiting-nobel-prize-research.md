I have been considering writing this post for over a year. I have mixed feelings about revisiting the Nobel prizes in physics with the knowledge of NPQG in hand. Let's go through the set of conflicting thoughts that run through my mind.

- The Nobel Prize is considered the highest award in physics (and other fields) and the award and winners are generally held in high esteem.

- Modern day criticism of the Nobel Prize concept resonates with me, specifically that it reinforces the power and competition hierarchy of academic physics which _**has been**_ and _**still is**_ dominated by a non-diverse group and which leads to unhealthy behaviour in the physics community.

- I don't wish to tarnish the past prize in the eyes of the public, the scientific community, nor the recipients. However, science marches onward. It is inevitable that if a paradigm shift occurs in a field, that many of the past results, while possibly fine work in their era, are rendered incorrect, obsolete, or misinterpretations by the science of the new era.

- It is important for science historians to understand and document the errors in thinking and faulty methods of prior eras and why those eras advocated incorrect narratives that deviated to a large degree from the ground truth of nature. While I am not a science historian, I have studied the history of physics, cosmology, and astronomy in order to fathom the errors and misinterpretations that have blinded these fields to solutions that are rather painfully obvious in retrospect.

Under the fair use doctrine, I have copied the text of the [All Nobel Prizes in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes-in-physics/) page from the Nobel Prize website. I've kept the links intact to the annual prize and winner pages. I will add my comments in **red font** if NPQG has a material impact on the science that led to the prize and **green font** if NPQG impact is none to minimal. Where I use an **orange font**, NPQG will have a material impact to the area, but it is unknown if it will impact the research for which the prize was awarded. If there is no comment after a prize winner section then either I have not found a serious NPQG impact to that research or I have not yet evaluated it.

NPQG will undoubtedly have a degree of impact on all science of standard matter-energy in spacetime √¶ther going forward. However, prior work may be minimally impacted at its scale of reference. I'll use the symbol **ùõøNPQG** to indicate Nobel prizes where there may be minor deltas or reframing needed in the context of NPQG and often this is with respect to the fundamental narratives of GR/QM/_Œõ_CDM.

The first version of this post will be a quick pass through, based simply on the high level description of the research for which the prize was awarded. In the future, I may come back and revisit some of these in more detail.

### The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020

The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics has not been awarded yet. It will be announced on Tuesday 6 October, 11:45 CEST at the earliest.

### [The Nobel Prize in Physics 2019](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/)

NPQG teaches that these concepts are all galaxy local and this resolves a number of tensions in cosmology that had largely been discounted by scientists, including the Hubble rate and the age of the universe relative to other processes. Presumably much of Dr. Peebles work can be mapped over to the galaxy local processes.**

**This work on _Œõ_CDM cosmology has been during an era where a fundamental narrative misconception has been in place - specifically the physical implementation of the Big Bang, inflation, and expansion as whole universe concepts (LeMaitre rewind to a _single_ event). NPQG teaches that these concepts are all galaxy local and this resolves a number of tensions in cosmology that had largely been discounted by scientists, including the Hubble rate and the age of the universe relative to other processes.

* * *

**The pattern is becoming evident.**

- **Research related to the paradoxes and open problems of physics and cosmology are highly likely to be materially impacted by NPQG.**

- **The smaller the scale of the study domain the more likely that NPQG will have a material impact. This includes small physical scale and low energy reactions. Definitely anything involving photons. Definitely anything involving spacetime √¶ther interactions. Certainly standard model and below. Possibly atomic and molecular research.**

- **The larger the scale of the study domain the more likely that NPQG will have a material impact. This includes high energy scales as well as large distance scales. Impacted subjects span universe as a whole, ŒõCDM** **cosmology, astronomy beyond our galaxy, galaxy dynamics, black holes, supermassive black holes and their jets, dark matter, dark energy, galaxy rotation curves, and high energy gravitatonal waves.**

- **Research in-between these extremes of scale is less likely to be directly impacted by NPQG as long as the science has minimal dependency on the narrative from the extremes of scale. That said, there may be advances in these areas that will be enabled by NPQG.**

**Beyond this point, I'll comment on the Nobel prizes that are significantly impacted by NPQG.**
