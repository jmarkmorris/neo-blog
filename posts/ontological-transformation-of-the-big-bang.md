Cosmology is way off course due to the crisis in particle physics. However, it is simple to think our way out of this crisis. Check out this video for a quick overview of alternatives to the Big Bang and then I'll show how we can perform ontological transformations and merge the best ideas from the various conceptualizations into a far more sensible cosmological framework.

Let's review what science abstractly deduces about cosmology.

- Our observations of the eldest photons from farthest away show that those photons have lost energy, i.e. redshifted. (CMB)

- Spacetime inflates, expands, and contracts. (Einstein, Guth, et al)

- Matter can emerge from spacetime via pair production.

- Matter can return to spacetime via pair annihilation.

Imagine all energetic matter, including spacetime itself, as being based upon a substructure that implements the characteristics of spacetime. A substructure that implements spacetime would, of course, implement the characteristics of spacetime. If we consider standard matter particles to be based on the same substructure that implements spacetime then by definition standard matter would also inflate and expand as it dissipated energy. Furthermore, DeBroglie showed us that standard matter has a frequency and wavelength, similar to photons. Everything can dissipate energy, i.e. redshift (or gain energy, blueshift).

Now we are in a realm where all matter-energy is built upon chunks of spacetime substructure and everything including spacetime can gain energy, dissipate energy, and react to transmute and form other structures.

In this realm let's redefine a "bang" as the exposure of high energy structures to an environment with less apparent energy. This happens all the time and all over the place as we can plainly observe. What happens? The high energy structures dissipate energy to other structures. The high energy structures react and transmute into different strucures. This process continues until some sort of equilibrium occurs.

Where do we find such processes? Galaxies are of course a huge source of such high energy events, from novae to quasars. But even a pair production event in deep spacetime qualifies.

Likewise there are processes which concentrate matter energy, such as gravitational attraction. This concentration reaches its local zenith inside black holes and ultimately inside the largest black holes, of which SMBH in galactic centers are an exemplar.

Energy is neither created nor destroyed, so we can think of the collection of all of these processes as a universe sized recycling system. High energy structures form, are exposed to a volume of space with lower energy-matter density, react and dissipate energy and expand and transmute, and yet also this is balanced by processes going the other way, increasing the density of matter-energy.

Stop here and ask why do we need a single inflationary big bang event, even one distributed throughout the whole universe? We don't. A recycling process as I have described, distributed through time and space with no known beginning nor end will produce exactly what we observe.

Our scientists might observe the eldest most distant CMB photons and might correctly attribute their redshift to expansion. That expansion is only required to be a local phenomenon experienced by the photon itself and the local spacetime structures through which it traveled. We do not require the whole universe to be expanding outward, we only require local expansion. As long as the local expansion of spacetime structures is balanced by other recycling processes that concentrated energy into contracted structures then everything works out just fine. Therefore galaxies are not in general receding from each other. That idea is malarky.

Through this thought experiment we have no converged the main concepts of the Big Bang, inflation, expansion, steady state cosmology, cyclic universes and even the multiverse. They can all be unified by discarding the nonsense narratives and supporting nonsense sub-theories.

Operationally, the universe is simply a distributed recycling system of structures that change size with energy and which can react to transact energy or to transmute into different structures. Essentially the universe is more like chemistry than physics.

Each of the five ideas Paul reviewed as well as the Big Bang itself contains some elements of the truth. But they also each contain a lot of false narratives and erroneous supporting erroneous math. Here is a handy truth table.

| **Universe Characteristic** | **How is it implemented?** |
| --- | --- |
| spacetime | Point charges form structures termed Noether cores with three orbiting point charge binaries. Higgs aether assemblies have excellent shielding and are nearly undetectable. This explains why they are so lightly interactive. |
| standard matter | Various assemblies of Noether cores adorned with personality point charges.      **Photon** : pro and anti Noether cores, planar, contra rotating coaxially on the line of travel   **Fermion** : six point charges adorning a Noether core |
| inflation, expansion, contraction | As a Noether core gains or dissipates energy its size changes due to the dynamical geometry of the point charge structure. |
| expansion | New spacetime aether assemblies are generated via galaxy center SMBH emissions. As they dissipate energy they inflate, then continue at a slower rate we call expansion. The generation of new spacetime is balanced by galaxy local processes such as those that transform spacetime to fermions, photons, and neutrinos. Spacetime aether assemblies may also be recycled through black holes. Therefore universe expands in place, not outward. Photons think they are traveling through expanding aether, and they often are, but that expansion is not making galaxies get farther apart.      Note that in the LCDM universe expansion violates conservation of energy and so does photon redshift (both per Dr. Don Lincoln). In the point charge universe, energy is conserved under all conditions. |

Here's a talk from Dr. Don Lincoln on the Big Bang timeline.

Let's consider the ontological transformation of the Big Bang timeline. With NPQG, we can transform the convoluted LCDM narrative into a very sensible progression.

| Timeline | Dr. Don's   LCDM Narrative | Point Charge Universe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before T=0 | "Unknown" | The Planck point charge core of an SMBH contains maximally dense point charges at the Planck energy. Presumably SMBH spin creates intense frame dragging at the poles and jets of Planck point charge plasma from the core punches through at T=0. |
| T=0 secs   thru   10\-44 secs Planck time | "We are really quite ignorant of this early point of the universe."      The Big Bang event has a beginning, but not an explosion from a singularity, and not at a single place.   General relativity does not apply. | A large scale steady state universe is imagined with inflationary SMBH mini-bangs distributed isotropically in time and space.   Each mini-bang occurs over a specific time range and place and originates from the Planck point charge core.   General relativity does not apply to a Planck point charge core because it has ontologically replaced Einstein's singularity. In other words, Einstein's mathematics needs to be revised to add a hard stop at the Planck scale. |
| Planck time   10\-44 secs thru   10\-36 secs | "Informed guesses only"      Possibly some separation of gravity from the other forces. | Imagination: The Planck plasma jet is starting to move out of the core. As it emerges, the columnated jet gets wider, providing volume for point charges to move transverse to the jet and begin forming binary assemblies. Binary capture may begin in this period. |
| 10\-36 secs thru   10\-32 secs | "Unproven theoretical conjecture"      Universe double every 10\-36 seconds so 2100 inflation.      Inflation was faster than the speed of light, c. | This would map to the era of binary inflation and capture. One factor in the doubling is the rapid increase in binary radius. Another possible factor is binary capture hiding the smaller high energy binaries and puffing out into more 3D form.   The speed of inflation could map to the binary inflating from Planck scale where point charge velocity is greater than field speed @. |
| 10\-32 secs   thru   10\-13 secs    | "Speculative. The Blurry Time"      Energy is spreading out.   Higgs "turns on"   Particle mass begins   Electric charge begins   Quarks and Leptons | The Higgs implements spacetime aether which permeates space and time with near perfectly shielded pro and anti Noether cores coupled together. Mass is the apparent energy of point charge assemblies. It makes sense that if the Higgs has formed that any quarks and leptons would have mass. Electric charge was always present in the point charges, but since T=0 this is the first time range where any non-neutral assembly has formed. |
| 10\-13 secs | Observable in proton-proton collisions at CERN.      1016 Kelvin | Temperature is defined in terms of the kinetic energy of a particle, but this doesn't take into account the Noether core which contains extremely high velocity point charges and a lot of KE. It's not entirely clear how to map temperature, but one possibility is related to the group velocity and assembly KE. Another possibility is that weak charge excitation may relate to temperature. Weak charges may be the transducer of energy to and from a Noether core. |
| 10\-6 secs | 1013 Kelvin      Protons and neutrons form. | This is part of the emergent assembly process in nature. |
| 1 sec | 1010 Kelvin      Neutrinos stop interacting. | Perhaps neutrinos stay small since they are stable, while other assemblies are still inflating and expanding. Thus eventually the neutrino's pass right by or through without interacting. Speculative. |
| 100 secs | 108 Kelvin   Hydrogen and Helium **nuclei** form.   Nucleosynthesis | This is part of the emergent assembly process in nature. |
| 380K years | 4000 Kelvin   Hydrogen and Helium **atoms** form.   The universe becomes electrically neutral.   Before this time photon travel distance was short. | The universe is always electrically neutral.   However, in terms of charged particle distribution, it appears that electrons have generally been captured by protons at this point.      This timeline and these processes presumed to occur along the jet and at the terminii. |
| 100M years | The dark age.   Universe filled with gas.   Stars form.   Galaxies form. | This timeline and these processes presumed to occur along the jet and at the terminii.      New galaxies are created. |
| 9B years | Dark energy | There is a huge amount of energy shielded in spacetime aether assemblies (e.g., Higgs). |
| 13.77B years | Now |  |
| Eventually | Heat Death, Big Crunch etc. | The universe is steady state on large scales.   There is no known end. |

Here's a video from Anton Petrov that discusses an Ultra Massive Black Hole (~20 to 140 B solar masses) that has been erupting massive amounts of energy for 100M years.
