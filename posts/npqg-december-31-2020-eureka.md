7 :00 AM — Eureka. This is it. I think I have found the general pattern. It looks like concentric nested shell gyroscopic cores with the _**personality on the outside**_. Energetic binaries are a reusable block.

This all leads to a regular structure which will probably explain everything. It looks sort of like nested eggs growing layer after layer of shell and often alternating positive negative if possible. That makes sense considering the maelstrom's point charges find themselves in at high energy. It is capture or be captured or both! Most of the time it is both! Someday high school physics students will get homework lessons to calculate the percentage of the universe's point particles at each layer of the nested shell architecture.

7 :30 AM — The first written post of the idea. The universe can be completely described in a very short set of identities and equations using regular expressions of energetic point charges and their conserved characteristics.

8 :30 AM — I'll start with regular expression symbols and syntax that can be typed easily on a standard keyboard. There will multiple implementations of the regular expression symbols and syntax : mathematical, visual, tactile, programming language, JSON, object, api, etc. Implementations of the language will emerge that that are purpose built for specific purposes.

9 :00 AM — My first attempt may not be the most elegant, but it will be a launching point for further advancement. The specification below is evolving rapidly and non-linearly. I would like it to be as parsimonious as possible. I imagine in pure math it will be very short. Perhaps the shortest specification could vie with Lenz's paper for the title plus explain the ratio of the mass of the proton to the electron.

10:00 AM — Made good progress. I'm building up the language to specify the Eureka discovery by thought experiment. It's really quite amazing. Nature loves patterns.

Noon — The table and patterns are taking shape. There are going to be a lot of beautiful ways to illustrate the architecture of nature. It's basically like counting off in binary with the zeros and ones corresponding to minus and plus or vice versa. One way is matter and the other is anti-matter. Nature appears to prefer negative or neutral shells adjacent to spacetime aether. Positive charge on the outside orbit, mixing with all the other standard matter abundant in spacetime seems to cause instability. Why? Why and how did the universe implement this asymmetry? Is it logical?

1:00 PM — The encoding of the standard model is going extremely well. Insights are flowing as I build out the regex language of nature. See the table towards the end of this post!

3 :00 PM — NPQG decoding of nature's encoding is complete up to the major standard model particles, the proton, neutron and the pi mesons as well. It is an extremely regular structure.

**Language of Nature and the Universe**

An emerging specification of the regular expression symbols and syntax for nature, emergence, and the universe.

Foundation for the Language

I'll aim to capture the spirit of Bell Labs Unix shell regular expressions in some of the symbols. Some symbols will be yet another abstract repurposing that overloads the use cases of existing symbols. I'll explain the choices and improved languages will emerge.

- The symbol for a relationship will be ':'
    - a correspondence,
    
    - a function,
    
    - etc.

- The symbol for any number of repeats of the previous regular expression is '\*'

- The symbol for the logical not is '!'

- The symbols for **a** valid pattern in a set of matching patterns are brackets '\[' and '\]'

- The symbols around a nested containment orbits are '(' and ')' and the contents are read left to right, inner most orbit to outer most orbit.

- Patterns may be separated with ',' **and** whitespace.

**0 The Vessel of the Universe**

Symbols of the foundation.

- The symbol for Euclidean space and time will be zero, '**0**'.
    
    - 0 represents a foundational structure to the universe.
        - a geometry.
        - absolute immutable 3D Euclidean space.
        - absolute immutable forward linear time.
    
    - 0 represents zero content in 3D Euclidean space and time.
        - no point charges
        
        - no energy
    
    - 0 : \[geometry, 3D Euclidean space, 3D Euclidean time, no contents\]

- The symbol '=' represents a particular **point** in Euclidean space and time.
    - 0 : the set of all \[=\]
    
    - The = may take some getting used to, because _reasons_. (ht/PS)
    
    - It makes sense because the universe operates based on the path where the point of action of immutable charges '.' coincides with a coordinate '=' in Euclidean space and time.
        - point charge worldline : 4D path : the set of all \[= : .\]

## **0 The Ingredients of the Universe**

Energetic immutable point charges.

- The symbol for an immutable point charge is a '.'

- A point charge carries two types of energy.
    - Kinetic energy as a vector.
    
    - Electromagnetic energy as a vector.
    
    - Energy is conserved in any reaction.

- The symbol for a positive point charge, the positrino, is '+'
    - Synonyms + : \[+,tbd\]

- The symbol for a negative point charge, the electrino, is '-'
    - Synonyms - : \[-, tbd\]

#### Metrics

I don't know if this is what physicists define to be a metric, but that word seems to fit. I think of it in terms of object oriented software.

- Every continuous coordinate position in space and time can be described as a set of metrics. A point in Euclidean space and time can be associated with one and only one of the following states.
    - '-' : the center of an electrino, its point of electromagnetic action.
    
    - '+' : the center of a positrino, its point of electromagnetic action.
    
    - '?' : The interior of the sphere of immutability around a point charge, less the center point itself.
        - ? : !\[-0+\]
    
    - '0' : void space not contained within any point charge.

- Each point charge is associated with a set of metrics.
    - charge
    
    - electromagnetic energy, a vector in space and time
    
    - kinetic energy, a vector in space and time.

- Each point charge is associated a point in 4D Euclidean space and time only momentarily as the point charge responds dynamically to conditions.

#### Assemblies

It's turtles all the way down. (J/K)

- The composition of an assembly is denoted with parenthesis.
    - The choice of '(' and ')' is to evoke containment.
    
    - The parenthesis and brackets may be omitted in context.
    
    - Vessel structure : \[0\], or (0), or 0
    
    - Point charge structure : (\[.\]), or (\[-+\]), or (.) or (-), or (+)
    
    - Composite structure : (base structure, structure)
    
    - Tau structure : **~** : (-+), or (+-), or (-/+) : binary orbit(s)

- Assemblies may be nested
    - structure : (structure, structure\*)

- Each point charge executes a continuously evolving wave equation as influenced by the metrics at its point of action.
    - The mathematical equations are a function of the coinciding Euclidean space time metric and the point charge metric.

- Repetitive wave functions are a sign of composite structure.

- There is such a thing as chaos and disorder, but in all cases it is point charges responding dynamically to the situation.

- The truly amazing thing about nature and the universe is that emergence creates stable assemblies out of point charges that are just following their nose.

#### Reactions

This is going to be a whole 'nuther set of manuals.

- Start with the capture process.

- Eventually get to W and Z bosons and their reaction interaction with spacetime aether structure.

- Conservation
    - Energy
    
    - Point charges

#### A Table of Structures

Note that there are many rows not populated. Those may well correspond to other particles listed by the Particle Data Group, [PDG](https://pdg.lbl.gov/). I've sent them clues about NPQG along the way and they have not acknowledged them, but they have responded to my requests for an API. That will become a high priority.

Particles are relatively easy to decipher now that we have found the Rosetta stone. Who knew the flip side of general relativity, quantum mechanics, and lambda cold dark matter was 'energetic immutable point charges' combining in binary nested spiral form? There is so much more of the Rosetta stone to leverage as we continue to relentlessly link the prior era sciences of GR, QM, and LCDM to NPQG.

In the table below there are a number of known unknowns each of which nature will reveal in time.

- the radii and frequency of each of the point charges

- the energy shielding characteristics of each binary

- the apparent energy at rest, what science calls 'mass'.

- the actual ordering of interior point charge orbits is unknown.

- More abstractly we might say that the point charge implementation of the wave equation of each shell is unknown.

Errors and typos are likely at this point.
