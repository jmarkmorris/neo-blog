I like to watch the “**_Ask a Spaceman!_**” videos produced by Dr. Paul Sutter. Paul has a gift for explaining complex information in an understandable and often humorous way. In this post I’ll comment on a transcript (fair use) from his video "The Mystery Of The Missing Matter In The Universe" and show how NPQG teaches these subjects differently from GR-QM era physics.

In quote blocks below is the transcript edited for brevity. The bold text is where the GR-QM-ΛCDM narrative is incorrect. I will interleave my commentary between the quotes.

> _"Today I'm talking about the **missing baryon problem**. Baryon is a particle physics word that means heavy. Heaviness really has nothing to do with it when it comes to astronomy, cosmology, and astrophysics. Baryons are protons, neutrons, hydrogen and helium and all normal matter, the matter that lights up as stars, galaxies, clouds of gas, and dust._

We will learn that in NPQG there is no missing baryon problem. Several mechanisms will be described that will inform the accounting for all baryons and all electrinos and positrinos too. Technically, since we don't know whether the universe is infinite or not, we can't actually account for **_all_** of these particles, but we can determine how many we would expect to find in various neighborhoods, regions, and large scale volumes of the universe.

> _The missing baryon problem is the fact that we only observe about half of the baryons we expect based upon our scientific calculations. We use very reliable calculations \[based on\] two observations that determine how many total baryons there are in the universe. The first is **Big Bang** nucleosynthesis calculations of what **the universe was like** when it was only like ten to twenty minutes old, small, dense, and had a temperature of billions of degrees Kelvin. The **whole entire universe** was a nuclear furnace where protons and neutrons were forming and thence crashing into each other._

To correct this paragraph we merely need to switch out a one time inflationary big bang for a _galaxy-local, parallel, intermittent, inflationary mini-bangs caused by the Planck core of galaxy center supermassive black holes breaching the event horizon at the poles and emitting Planck plasma jets that travel for enormous distances._ Yes, that's a mouthful, and eventually we will find a term to simplify it. Perhaps the term **AGN** for active galactic nuclei could be adapted for this purpose. NPQG establishes the case for a recycling process where matter-energy that falls into a supermassive black hole is recycled through the zero-entropy Planck core phase of matter-energy and then jetted out to begin anew. To lesser extents various recycling processes may also occur in the hot furnace cores of stars, neutron stars, magnetars, and black holes. This is a natural outcome of NPQG because we stipulate that the electrino and positrino point charges are immutable. Therefore matter-energy in a black hole has an ultimate density of electrinos/positrinos and energy that can not be overcome—the Planck scale. That single assumption closes the loop on a grand galactic and universe wide recycling transformation that consists of cycles upon cycles of motion, energy, and reactions in the universe.

> _In the meantime the **universe** is getting bigger and slowly cooling down so the reaction rates are going down. We understand this era of the **universe** relatively well because we can apply the same math that we used to solve nuclear physics to the world of the **universe** when it was just a dozen minutes old. At first everything's too hot and everything's too dense and nothing can stabilize. For a very brief window the **universe** is able to manufacture the lightest elements because you get protons and neutrons. Then as the **universe** gets older it gets bigger and less dense and colder and so the nuclear reactions just freeze out. The protons and neutrons never even meet each other again so there's a very fine window of when hydrogen can be produced and helium and a little bit of lithium and we can predict what the ratios of these elements ought to be. We are able to predict the universe should be three-quarters hydrogen, one-quarter helium, and a dash of other atoms and that's exactly what we observe. These calculations also tell us how many total baryons are in the universe. It's around five percent of all the matter and energy in the entire universe goes into baryons, i.e., normal matter._

This paragraph can be corrected by simply replacing the **bolded** uses of the term 'universe' with 'galaxy local inflationary mini-bang'. This is a simple transformation of the concept and the net results is similar, and furthermore the NPQG solution will lead to much better scientific understanding of these galactic processes and the Universe as a whole.

> _The second prediction is from the **Cosmic Microwave Background** this is the leftover light from when the **universe** was just 380,000 years old. This is the epoch in the **universe** when a transition from being a hot dense plasma where you had hydrogen and helium nuclei, protons, and then you had electrons all whizzing around. It's an energetic situation like before, but a little bit cooler and then it gets cold enough where the electrons join atoms, the atoms are independent, and the light can just freestream throughout the universe until we pick it up today._

Again we replace the uses of 'universe', let's say with "each AGN" and now we also need to understand that the CMB is not leftover radiation from the Big Bang, but the net background radiation from the overall distributed intermittent AGN processes over time. NPQG calls this the black body radiation of spacetime æther.

> _So we have a picture of the **universe** from when it was only 380,000 years old. From that picture we can determine that the universe is made of 5% baryons or normal matter. The challenge with finding all the baryons is that not all baryons light up. Not all baryons get themselves inside of stars and start glowing and get inside galaxies where the galaxies are glowing so we can see it with a telescope. We're missing about half of the baryons when we go looking for them. They're not in stars. They're not in galaxies. They are not in gas clouds. They're not in compact objects like like rogue planets or black holes or cold white dwarfs. They're just missing hence the missing baryon problem. Maybe next week I might propose the solution to the missing baryon problem._

So where are all these missing baryons? With the advent of NPQG we will need to initiate a new scientific investigation to account for electrinos and positrinos on various scales. It will be a much more rigorous science than ΛCDM because we have a much deeper understanding of nature with NPQG and we can do a physical accounting of immutable particles, which by their nature of being immutable are also conserved. One rather large repository of electrinos and positrinos is in spacetime æther. Not only will spacetime æther help solve the missing baryon problem, but it will also help solve the problem that has been called 'dark matter. On top of that, given the incorrect GR-QM-ΛCDM narrative about black hole singularities and wormholes and such, it should be clear that Planck cores of electrinos and positrinos, or even particle cores near to those energies, contain the raw materials that could form new baryons upon emission and contribute to the solution.
