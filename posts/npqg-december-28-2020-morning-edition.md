_I am brainstorming ideas during NPQG Breakthrough Days. Enjoy_.

Overnight, it occurred to me that the Planck 'constants' apply to a free binary, not to a collection of binaries reacting with one another in a supermassive black hole core. At the Planck energy a binary isolated in absolute Euclidean space, could still rotate, be it ever so slowly at one cycle per Planck time. Theoretically, an electrino and a positrino, each with the Planck energy stored (almost entirely) kinetically, could be on a path towards each other that is the perfect path for Coulomb's law and classical mechanics to operate together to so they enter into this tiniest of orbits where they appear to be rotating while adjacent and the energy is stored almost entirely electromagnetically.

The implications of this insight are :

- The Planck length Lp, may not be the ultimate radius of the binary rotation when adjacent.

- Instead, Lp may be the path length of the closest orbit at adjacency.

- If so, then r at adjacency is Lp/**τ** = Lp/2π.

I'll think on that for a while and if it becomes clear that this is how nature works, I'll adjust the model for this new insight on the natural basis of Lp as the circumference of a planar binary orbit at adjacency. Another reason this makes sense is that if you think of using Lp for an absolute ruler, how would you fix one end of the ruler at the origin inside the point charge. Maybe it makes more sense to measure the circumference which is accessible. One full orbit of adjacent point charges is theoretically observable (not practically though) in nature, so that suggests Lp is a better fit as that metric.

If this line of thinking is correct, the state of zero energy for a binary is hard to fathom as is the state of Planck energy plus one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy. If we examine the electromagnetic field energy in concentric spherical surface layers then the sum of that field energy in each surface layer would correspond to one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy. For a binary orbiting at a frequency of 1 cycle per absolute second, the interior of the shell contains one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy and the entire volume of the void background space outside the shell contains one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy. This seems like it would involve mathematical integration. This makes sense since there are two point charges and a total of two Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy for a one Hz binary. Is it always the case that the field energy inside a binary equals the field energy outside the binary, that the total energy of a binary is always equally split between interior and exterior? Again, let's go back to the adjacent binary with the Planck energy per point charge. That would suggest that the field inside the spherical layer from Lp/**τ** to 2Lp/**τ** contains one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy and the field energy outside the 2Lp/**τ** sphere, i.e., the remainder of the universe is also one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s units of energy. These are interesting thoughts and I need to noodle them for a while to see if they hold. The next step is to gather all the formulas for the Planck constants and see what they reveal for the adjacent point charge case. We also need to think about what the experiences of the local observer and the Euclidean observer.

In the Euclidean frame we see that the binary has a frequency of 1 Hz at its lowest per point charge energy level of one Planck’s constant **h** J⋅s as well as at the maximum Planck energy. That is odd to think about. For every energy level of the binary, is the energy divided between equally between kinetic and electromagnetic forms? Is this leading towards permittivity and permeability being where the Lorentz factor comes into play? This is promising. Stay tuned.

I have been thinking about how the assemblies of standard model particles might be architected.

- Is it a nested set of binaries as the nucleus?

- Is it possible that personality potentials can be stable in the poles?

We already know about the Koide formula and have linked it up to NPQG.

- Koide formulas appear to describe three 3 orthogonal layers as containment binaries for the electron(muon(tau)) and the field interactions between them.

- They suggest that the muon and tau are actually contained by the outer core of the electron.

- They suggest that a core layer can mask or shield the energy in whole or in part from the internal binaries.

Wave equations for less complex particle structures may be available. Perhaps by studying them insight can be gained about the shell architecture. The NPQG decoding of stable standard matter in order of total point charges is :

- Neutrino : 3:3 (3:3)

- Photon : 6:6

- Electron : (6:0) (3:3)

- Neutron : 18:18

- Proton : 15:21

In 1951 Friedrich Lenz identified an interesting case of numerology potentially related to the ratio of the Proton and Electron masses.

- Lenz wrote what is considered the shortest paper ever published in Physical Review.

- The number, 6π5, is potentially a clue since we know fermion generations increase in mass by many multiples each generation.

- Also the π is promising since we are considering orbits related to circles and spheres.

- It is thought that the proton mass consists primarily of gluons and the quarks.

- There is a hint in NPQG that gluons may be binaries.

- _"A gluon (/ˈɡluːɒn/) is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between quarks. It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles."_ — Wikipedia

- I'm imagining the quark's yielding some of all of their shells and some of those shells forming the outer containment for the proton and others becoming binaries trapped along with the at least partially de-shelled quarks.

- The gluon has only two polarization states.

- If there are three colors and three anti-colors that could correspond to a tri-binary with three orthogonal binaries.

What is the implementation of "anti-ness"?

- It could be the point charges executing the wave equation forwards vs. backwards. I thought a binary would have that symmetry though, why would it matter which way it is rotating _if it is free_?

- "**If it is free**." — is that a clue? Maybe there is more structure than I realized and that makes a difference which way each binary is rotating.

- Only certain structures are stable for any significant length of time. So the wave equations for the point charges in a structure must be just right to maintain stability.

- If binaries are cycling in synchronicity, perhaps a conflict arises if some binaries are at 1/2 frequency which can happen since it is a spin 1/2 particle. At a 1/2 frequency step the point charges are in opposite position compared to at integer frequencies.

Can low energy spacetime aether assemblies exist inside of a standard model assembly? Do they pass through? Or do standard matter assemblies pass right through the orbits of low energy spacetime aether particles, with their relaxed radii? Remember, spacetime aether assemblies are extremely non-interactive, but they do have a tiny apparent energy. Yet, close to an energetic assembly the aether is gaining energy radiated by the apparent energy (ne mass) of the matter. Clearly the aether must be right along side if not passing right through.

Einstein is noted for the concept of energy mass equivalence and the popular equation $latex \\mathbf{E=mc^{2}} &s=2$ for an object at rest. A better description is : Mass is a measure of how your apparent electromagnetic energy couples with spacetime aether. Your inertial energy is your apparent energy paced by permittivity and permeability. It's that simple. We know $latex \\mathbf{c^{2}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\mu }} &s=2$. We can express mass as $latex \\mathbf{m = E \\epsilon \\mu } &s=2$. Makes a lot more sense right? Now consider the electric and magnetic fields expressing your energy. The electric field expression is paced by permittivity $latex \\mathbf{\\epsilon} &s=2$ and the magnetic field expression is paced by the permeability $latex \\mathbf{\\mu} &s=2$. Rest mass is a simple concept and Einstein made it complicated.

What is the energy momentum equation telling us? Notice the form $latex \\mathbf{a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}} &s=2$ which is the form of the Pythagorean theorem for the relationship of three sides of a right triangle. So the theorem is really telling us that these two forms of energy, your rest energy coupling and your moving energy coupling are orthogonal. They are vector components. You add them as you add vectors. It is as if your energy has a direction. Your apparent energy at rest is the lossless AC coupling of your composite particles to spacetime aether. If a force is applied to accelerate you, it is causing binaries in your shells to gain energy. If after doing work W, the force is removed, you now have momentum and your binaries plateau in energy. Why is that not simple addition?

Oh, I see, this starts as a very acute triangle. You are not really adding all that much energy to your shells until you start getting fairly near c. Then the energy spikes. What is happening from our Euclidean observers point of view as you get close to local **c**? They are seeing you slow down and shrink and they notice you have to apply ever increasing amounts of energy for your binaries to continue to speed up. Why? Two reasons. Coulomb's law and the density of the electromagnetic fields causing permittivity and permeability to change. It is only in a Planck core that the final step occurs which has not been considered before. Once you pack those Planck energy binaries together, they can not rotate relative to each other, although possibly the entire core could rotate as a whole.
