Scientists have examined a galaxy's SMBH jets and found that they accelerate! This looks like evidence of inflation to me, which NPQG predicted. Let's check out Anton's video and discuss!

Here are the facts conveyed by Anton

- The galaxy studied is known as Centaurus A.

- The Centaurus A AGN SMBH is about 55 million masses of the Sun which is 12 times more massive than the Milky Way SMBH.

- The jets from the Centaurus A AGN SMBH act as a particle accelerator for thousands of light years.

- This redefines our knowledge of astrophysical jets in the universe.

- Scientists are questioning if the jets are the effects of the accretion disc or if they are related to the black hole itself.

- Scientists always believed that jets lose energy as they moves away from the black hole but nobody ever questioned if that's the reality.

- Scientists will look at other nearby galaxies with this methodology.

- Centaurus A jets move at about 55% of the speed of light, which is relatively slow for an astrophysical jet which normally approach speeds of about 99 percent of the speed of light.

- The radio frequency radiation shows these jets are roughly a few million light years in length but it also has quite a lot of higher energy X-ray Jets that are a few thousand light years long.

- These X-ray and gamma ray emissions are not easily explainable.

- It's as if something is accelerating the matter in the jet all across the jet's length.

- This finding explains observations of highly energetic gamma ray from elsewhere in the universe.

- This means that the radio galaxies are extremely efficient at creating a lot of energy across the universe and are also extremely efficient at spewing out lots of matter in all sorts of directions.

- It's basically like the fountains of the universe although in this case these fountains don't just produce matter and they also seem to produce tremendous amounts of energy but this is only in regards to radio galaxies for now.

This result is an exciting confirmation of the NPQG prediction that the universe is based on galaxy local cosmology with mini-bangs, inflation, and expansion all being galaxy local. Clearly the accelerating jets are being driven by inflation.

Armed with this knowledge, scientists should re-evaluate their calculations of jet speed which they cap at 99% the speed of light by attributing any apparent superluminal observations to a narrow viewing angle. The reality that NPQG predicts is that Planck scale point charge plasma jets can obliterate the spacetime æther structures in the path of the jet, in which case there would be nothing to prevent superluminal motion.

This is an excellent talk. Dr. Revalski is doing fine work showing all the structure from SMBH 'winds'. The visuals are amazing and a perfect fit for galaxy local inflationary mini-bangs as predicted by NPQG. I sent an inquiry :

> _Dear Dr. Revalski,_
> 
> _I very much enjoyed your talk about SMBH winds and galaxy influence._
> 
> _My immutable point charge model of the universe leads to the conclusion that LCDM is inside out and SMBH are responsible for inflationary mini bangs and galaxy-local expansion into neighboring galaxies._
> 
> _Your work looks to be a perfect fit to what I have predicted! Thank you. If you are up to it, I’d like to have a conversation with you sometime._

Here’s an interesting video lecture from the Hubble space telescope channel and what this suggests to me is that the bar in a galaxy, the X shape, and the spiral are possibly due to the Planck scale point charge jets from the galaxy center supermassive black hole. That is to say that the jet is not entirely perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy. What is the current knowledge of SMBH axial change relative to axial plane over long time scales? Does some of the material that was jetted from the SMBH and became standard matter eventually fall back onto the galaxy due to gravity? Does the returning material have anything to do with any portion of the galaxy rotation rate curve? Needless to say, but the point charge theory will cause quite a stir in galaxy dynamics.
