Is it the case that nature has two opposing processes that together recycle point charges and energy?

1. The radiation (dispersal or spread) of high-energy matter, typically in the forms of standard matter assemblies and spacetime assemblies, but also in energy transfer from high energy reactive assemblies to lower energy assemblies.

3. The concentration of matter-energy, typically the gravitational convection of matter-energy with less apparent energy towards forms of matter-energy with more concentrated energy.

In NPQG, we know that concentration of matter-energy due to gravitation tends to lead towards supermassive black holes and Planck scale point charge cores, the ultimate concentration of matter-energy. A Planck scale point charge core is the pinnacle in energy and point charge density and also a tipping point â€” a breach or flow of point charge assemblies through SMBH event horizon leads to the rapid escape and dispersal of energy and point charge assembly plasma which reacts and assembles into high energy gamma ray photons, neutrinos, and other forms of matter-energy, including assemblies of spacetime.

In nature's **steady state**, emergence from Planck energy point charges replenishes an emergent sea of assemblies. Beside the standard matter particle assembly zoo, these include point charge **assemblies** that implement a curvy stretchy aether that we call Einstein's spacetime. Nature is built **_right on top of_** a perfectly flat Euclidean void of time and 3D space. **Nature is a trickster.**

Technically the spacetime aether includes Higgs couplings of pro and anti Noether cores and may include ultimately redshifted neutrinos and photons, but until now there hasn't been a theory for ultimately redshifted versions of standard matter particle assemblies. I've been unable to find research on ultimately redshifted photons and scientists infrequently discuss redshift of standard matter particles, even though DeBroglie's research opens the door to this idea.

I am aware that there is a large body of research on **information,** and it may soon get quite contentious in academia about exactly what is happening in an SMBH. I think this will be quite exciting. I'm currently imagining how point charges would behave in a black hole and I hope I can understand what it all means fairly high up the knowledge hierarchy. It seems to me at the ultimate energy level of Planck point charge cores which may be followed by stealthy escape of spacetime assemblies or jetting of Planck energy scale point charge plasma would lose information. Yet, there is also possibility of some information leakage through the breaches in the event horizon. Can we really guarantee each point charge has been wiped clean at Planck energy for a cycle or two? Where else could the information go? There is no magic. The point charges escaping the black hole are reducing the point charges in the core and that means diminishing the state matrix. If information is conserved it seems logical that it must be expelled via the event horizon. Yet that contradicts other theories. I am a practical person. I don't see any requirement at all for preservation of information. My intuition says that most if not all assemblies decay by the time they reach the Planck core. One possible exception is point charge binaries, but even they may decay or join a super assembly. Any information carried by these assemblies into the core would be wiped clean. Zero residual information would remain.

This seems to have bearing on the second law of thermodynamics. Should it now be stated as an equality? I do not see nature expressing any preference in point charge and energy density from deep space to supermassive black hole cores. It's all good. It's a continuum with local hot spots. Towards the center the destiny is to join the Planck energy scale point charge core with zero entropy and frozen relative time. It is a lot to think about, but it seems to me that the NPQG model is enormously powerful.

This is a brainstorm on the topic of dominant cycle in the universe.

- Spacetime assemblies are created in supermassive black holes

- Spacetime assemblies may (potentially) be created in other extremely high energy environments such as black holes, neutron stars, etc. as well as high energy events such as jets, mergers, or collisions.

- Spacetime assemblies exist over a wide energy range, starting at the highest when created and dissipating energy until they reach the apparent energy of deep space.

- Like high energy photon assemblies, high energy spacetime assemblies have binary sub-assemblies with smaller orbital radii than lower energy spacetime assemblies.

- Since spacetime assemblies must escape their orbs or events that created them, it stands to reason that their stealthiness improves with energy, and they flow out of the SMBH through the event horizon.
    - Assembly stealthiness depends on many factors.
        - interaction scenario (passing by, collision, reaction)
        
        - physical size
        
        - shielding by superposition.
        
        - velocity.
    
    - What is the specific mechanism behind the relativistic mass of objects steeped in high energy spacetime assemblies, such as near an SMBH?
    
    - Photon speed (c) slows in higher energy spacetime. This is modeled by permittivity and permeability.

- Like photon assemblies, spacetime assemblies redshift, i.e., lose some energy to nearby spacetime assemblies along the path of the assembly.
    - In both cases the energy transfer is towards spacetime assemblies.
    
    - High energy spacetime assemblies dissipate energy to lower energy spacetime assemblies.

- Both photon and spacetime assemblies initially inflate and then expand as they lose energy.

- Inflation and expansion are directly related to the rate of increase of the orbital radii of the point charge binary sub-assemblies.

- As we know with Einstein's theory of general relativity, spacetime gets increasingly dense around high mass objects.
