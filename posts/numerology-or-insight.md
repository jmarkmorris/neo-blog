As I envision it, the three inner orbitals, which I call the Noether engine core, carry a LOT of responsibility (Dr. Guth will love how they inflate) and they are way too small and high energy for us to get a direct look at experimentally. But if you think about it, three vastly different high energy orbitals with three different angular momentum vector magnitudes has some really nice mathematical properties, e.g., chirality. Then the angles of the orbital planes changing with velocity are very interesting with respect to apparent energy and mass. 

I am thinking that a photon is a pro and an anti Noether core, each planar and orthogonal to the velocity and they must counter-rotate to generate our familiar electromagnetic waves. The two cores may be slightly offset. I can sort of visualize how polarization works. Also, yes, I’m thinking perhaps a photon can redshift so much it becomes a neutrino. This would require a longer discussion on the concept of apparent energy which relates to mass, and shielded energy of the gen II and III binaries.

There are many reaction processes that generate neutrinos, and likewise many that generate photons. If we want to tally the total energy of a structure we must sum the kinetic and potential energy of every point charge in the assembly. Most of that energy in a gen I fermion assembly is in the two tiniest binary orbitals in the Noether core engine and often that energy is shielded (precession effect from the outer binaries). This architecture predicts that an up quark contains the energy of the charm and top, for example.

Neutrino oscillation would be a dynamical change of the orientation angles of the three orbital planes that varies the shielding and hence the apparent energy which we equate to mass. Bosons are more flat and planar hence their statistics, whereas fermions are more 3D at rest and hence the Fermi-Dirac statistics. Performing work on a fermion and accelerating it causes the orbital planes of the core binaries to shift their orientation.
