There are two scientific phenomena that appeal to my senses of unnaturalness. First, the root cause of the behaviour in the physics delayed choice experiment, and entanglement in general, is still a leap of faith I am counting upon, per the advice of Dr. Lee Smolin. 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 is in good position to explain this phenomena because it has myriad potential causal mechanisms to investigate and supposedly pilot wave theories provide a path forward. It appears to me that 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 has energy based memory along with memory for all other conserved dimensions and quantities. While that memory may not be readable without destroying it, clearly it can bounce and ring for many orders of magnitude. I am pondering energy based harmonic wave series that are storable within particle cores and transferable in quanta between particle cores, and implemented by wave functions.

Second, at this point, I think it is possible that we may be in a **simulation**, even if it is limited to setting initial conditions. If we are in a simulation, **_we_**, **_you and me_**, are just as real, and the intelligent operator, **_Opie_**, is real too, not mythical. **_Opie_** established the initial conditions and may perturb the system at arbitrary absolute times. Even so, we have free will at every conscious moment. _See [Simulation, What is Possible?](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/07/05/simulation-what-is-possible/)_ for additional insight into this fascinating subject.

> _One of the hallmarks of Cultural Anthropology is that tribal history around the world includes creation myths.. This bleeds over into studies of human nature.  Given that tribes speak of origins in caves, kivas, or even a Mother Tree -  all show humans explaining their identities in terms of an Origin story. Microbiology showed the sperm and the egg which updated how babies originate. And GR-QM era physics has  provided a scientific answer in regard to origin of the universe via one time inflationary Big Bang and expansion._

In NPQG there may be no origin story. The most parsimonious conception is that the Universe is infinite and that time in the past and future is infinite. Still even if you have an origin story, it is normal to ask what caused the origin? What was the source of all that energy and matter? It seems more harmonious to me to say everything is infinite.  How would we ever know anyway?
