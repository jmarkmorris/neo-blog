- The general architecture design space to explore is:
    - A composite particle assembly is an energetic point charge hierarchy.

- - A binary has equal energy per point charge.

- An assembly may include nested subassemblies.

- - Could the personality charges be like moons orbiting in the poles of the binaries?
    - - To visualize you must zoom in with your mind's eye.

- - - Imagine the radius of the outer binary as orders of magnitude larger than the next binary, etc.

- Imagine six electrino personality charges at e/6 orbiting at a greater radius than the binary.


- Spin-Orbit Locking
    - Under what conditions do the point charges in different binaries synchronize their orbits?

- Random Thoughts
    - How does an assembly re-stabilize after work is done on its point charges and vice-versa?
    
    - Is inflation the inverse of Lorentz alpha in a sense? The Planck plasma produces binary based assemblies that inflate by coming down the Lorentz curve.
