How could we prove the proposition above?

1. First we show that such a binary of orbiting immutable point charges can be linked directly to the Planck units and equations as well as other core equations of physics.

3. Next we want to show that a binary can transact energy to or from angular momentum in units of h-bar at spin 1/2.

5. Then we must show how to derive Planck's Law based upon immutable point charges. The open question is whether this is from first principles or does this involve an interaction with an emergent aether structure? In one sense an aether appears to be required to provide structures to carry away energy. My guess is the answer will be 'both', defying the which came first question.

7. We need to tie in the immutability field effect and how nature implements it. What are the mathematical rules?

9. We need the solution for the permittivity and permeability of electric and magnetic fields in Euclidean space.

11. We need to demonstrate what the Euclidean observer sees and how truly sensible it is to envision a variable speed of light in the elastic aether.

One cool thing is that geometry plays such a huge role. Plus we pretty much know the target for the math, even if it does need some enhancement.

_A comment I made on the PBS SpaceTime discord server in response to someone attempting to visualize a discrete basis to nature :_ I rather think it is the other way around. A continuous Euclidean space and time, overlayed with immutable point charges that are rather fond of orbiting each other. Take two orbiting opposite point charges and they make a circuit that transacts angular momentum in h-bar. Thus physicists saw the quantum behaviour, but unfortunately could not peer beyond. The challenge is to split the quantum into its constituent unit potential point charges.

This calamity is somewhat understandable given that the classical world immediately drops some 20 orders of magnitude in size to immutable point charges with a field effect that provides a sphere of immutability, i.e., asymptotic safety. Then standard matter particles are emergent structures with inflatable-expandable energy cores made of coupled binaries at different energy levels. This 90 second video demonstrates the inflationary-expansionary character of nature, albeit with a Hoberman sphere rather than orbiting electrinos and positrino point charges. As a bonus, this demonstrates the conservation of angular momentum and why the structure would increase its orbital rate as the structure and the moment of inertial shrinks. This is a clue NPQG will leverage as well.

Now you actually have a mechanism that is both continuous fundamentally, but the most dominant structure, the binary, operates in quantum energy levels. It's the perfect structure to confuse physicists because gravity is simply based on the energy and energy gradient of the relatively low energy aether, which is also constructed with these point charge binaries. It's all so simple if physicists would simply take a breather and attack from underneath with point charges.

It is easy for example to derive the Planck unit formulas from a binary. Furthermore, a point charge binary is the perfect black body, as it absorbs any multiple of h-bar, yet will emit energy according to Planck's law by interacting with the aether medium and yielding h-bars to the nearby assemblies in a reaction. Oh, and the best part is how nature bounces back from that 20 order of magnitude drop in classical particle size just below the standard model -- the point charge binary is a stretchy ruler and a variable clock such that it **_maintains c as a constant when perceived from within the aether_**. Now, to be sure the binaries are just energy cores, and three of them coupled at different energies is a Noether conservation mechanism (gimbal). Then nature decorates these engines with various personalities to make standard matter. Map in QFT, QED, QCD around here somewhere.

We must at some point decide how the field effect of immutability is implemented. Surely there are clues in the mathematics, and we could approach it that way. However, I prefer to start with consideration from first principles and try to get a feel for how nature behaves from the contemporary interpretations, which often require conceptual translation to the point charge solution. Yes, it's twisted, but it's fun and leads to amazing insight.

Here is **a** key question. To what extent, if any, can fields traverse a point charge core? This is really interesting if you think about two same or opposite charges approaching each other. Is it a soft asymptotic safety bounce or a hard classical clank? Both are perfectly reasonable to consider and perhaps both play a role. I think Wilczek is pretty bright, but even he hasn't considered the problem from a perspective enlightened by immutable point charges.

What if it is different for like vs. opposite charges? Is a clank even possible for opposites or like point charges? By clank I mean an elastic kinetic collision. Are the forces the same for opposite charges with asymptotic safety as with like charges and repulsion? There may be an asymmetry lurking here. It's interesting to ponder whether we need an asymmetry at this level to explain nature. I prefer to choose the most parsimonious model as a first option, but it's nice to know we have this option given nature is a trickster, even now.

What are the combinations? It comes down to deciphering the clues from nature to model the field effect of immutability. We need to consider all the scenarios and there are three in the absence of any external stimuli.

- electrino : electrino

- electrino : positrino

- positrino : positrino

My subconscious has been slowly considering this for more than a year. It is an important factor in the model for immutable point charges. Certainly, whether the point charge spheres are opaque to passing fields, are conditionally opaque, or are completely transparent to the the fields emanating from other point charges must be very important, especially when in close quarters. This could lead to some fascinating dynamical geometry that I would love to hear about in outreach material some day. First things first. We need to link up to the existing math and see what clues it provides.
