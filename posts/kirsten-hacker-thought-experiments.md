Dear Kirsten,

Would you expand on the Gell-mann quarks example in this quote from your article: "_They draw inferences which go far beyond what the experimental data suggests. Gell-Mann’s nuclear model with quarks is a good example of this._"

The reason I ask is that in my model with electrino-positrino for standard model particles, one interpretation is that quarks are only a by-product of blowing up a neutron or proton (or meson…) with a particle accelerator. As I understand it, modern particle physics stipulates that quarks only exist inside hadrons, such as the proton and neutron. There is also speculation of quark stars. It may be possible that quarks are simply common **_fragments_** that result from a particle collision in a high energy collider and that may occur in nature at equivalent temperatures.

It kind of makes sense that experiments might fail to detect electrino/positrino shells for standard matter and spacetime æther particles because they are difficult to observe directly. Of course, we know that they are difficult to observe directly, since Michelson-Morley (and follow-ons) failed to detect them.

This makes further sense if you consider that Gen I fermions might have a full core of say three electrino/positrino binaries to provide stability in three dimensions x-y-z. Then Gen II fermions at higher energy, have decomposed somewhat and are far less stable because they have only two binaries in their core. Continuing, Gen I fermions at even higher energy might have a very fragile partial core containment of one electrino/positrino binary. This all makes perfect sense. Gen I is stable as we know, because it has three binaries and space is three dimensional. Gen II and III are progressively less stable with two and one binaries respectively.

You can imagine the energy levels in a neutron star, black hole, or supermassive black hole. Or the energy levels in certain collisions. If the particles are spherically layered and therefore mostly surrounded by other particles at the same energy level (temperature), then there will be continuous deconstruction into various composites that can exist at that temperature and pressure until only the most fundamental particles are remaining.

It makes sense to me intuitively, that the ultimate arrangement must be electrinos and positrinos (which have 1/6th charge) in the most awesome battery in the universe. It must arrange electrinos and positrinos, possibly in a lattice (with faults), that holds the most possible energy, the Planck energy for each particle. This is something that can probably be solved by thought experiment and theory and verified by simulation.

One might imagine a lattice, perhaps a face centered cubic (FCC) lattice. I envision a core of interleaved particles packed so tightly at the Planck scale that they cannot move, that the local speed of light is zero, that all of the energy is stored in the electric field via attraction and repulsion (There is no magnetic field if all electrinos and positrinos have velocity of 0). The core has only one microstate. Entropy of the core is zero. However, due to conservation of entropy, energy, and momentum (linear and angular) when particles join the Planck core, the next hottest particles do the heavy lifting for conservation of entropy and momentum.

As you know some black holes spin very fast. When spinning, the black hole and presumably also any Planck core, become oblate spheroids. In an oblate spheroid the layers _outside_ the Planck core are the thinnest at the poles. There is also a strong magnetic field aligned on the polar axis. If the Planck core breached the event horizon as Planck plasma it would most likely happen at the poles, except in collision situations that could cause a chaotic and potentially catastrophic breach. I've written several posts about black holes and what happens next, and you can find those in the [NPQG Table of Contents](https://johnmarkmorris.com/).
