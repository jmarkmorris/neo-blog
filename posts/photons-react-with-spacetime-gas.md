**Redshift.** In NPQG, photons can lose energy (i.e., "_**redshift**_") as they travel through spacetime æther. I imagine that there is a mapping of redshift rate and lensing effects to general relativity. Now we need to model at the more specific level of expanding spacetime aether assemblies and their geometry in the "curvy-stretchy" regime of Einstein. Clearly there are various shifting conditions that must be accounted for in the NPQG redshift model.

What do we know?

- Energy is conserved.

- Photon energy transfer can be quantized. Are there also continuous forms of redshift that perhaps involve the phase of the binaries in the assembly?

- We know that certain light generating events emit photons of a particular wavelength which translates into a specific energy.

- We know that as photons pass through expanding spacetime æther their wavelength is elongated and frequency decreased.

- We know the wavelength of the detected photon.

- We know that these photons have lost energy along their journey.

What don't we know?

- What is the exact mechanism of the energy transfer between photons and the expanding spacetime æther?

- Does the reaction vary with the energy gradient of the spacetime æther?

- Does the reaction vary with the energy of the photon?

- What happens at the extremes of high apparent energy and low apparent energy spacetime æther?

- What happens at the extremes of high and low apparent energy photons.

I imagine some sort of function that describes photon energy loss per unit distance traveled as a function of photon energy and spacetime æther energy.

|  | **Extremely High Energy Spacetime   (near or in a neutron star or black hole)      local speed of light = slow** | **Mid Energy Spacetime   (near a planet or star)** | **Low Energy Spacetime   (in space far from celestial objects)   local speed of light ~= standard c** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High Energy Photon | This photon has a small radius, but the spacetime   æther particles are dense here.   These photons would experience significant refraction. | Refraction | Galaxy local expansion |
| Mid Energy Photon | These photons would experience significant refraction. | Moderate refraction. | Galaxy local expansion |
| Low Energy Photon | These photons may experience such high refraction that their path is redirected to impact with the dense object or to decay. | Low refraction?   Is there a lower bound where the photon decays? | Galaxy local expansion.   Is there a lower bound where the photon decays? |

A detailed scientific understanding of the reaction between photons and spacetime æther is required to determine absolute distance in space as a function of photon redshift.

**Synchrotron Radiation.** Do photons give off synchrotron radiation when accelerated? We need to use the Euclidean frame when considering photon acceleration, since general relativity says a photon path may curve because of an abstract **geometry** of spacetime, rather than a material aether. If a photon is passing by a black hole and being lensed (refracted) by gravity (the energy and energy gradient of aether), then in the Euclidean frame the photon is experiencing acceleration. There are plenty of low energy spacetime aether particles ready to accept an energy transfer so all the reactants are present for creating or launching a new energetic photon.

The orbiting binaries that compose a photon structure rotate in a plane perpendicular to the velocity vector. It appears that the outer Gen I (and perhaps the inner Gen II and III) binaries are contra-rotating. Some forms of polarization appear to be caused by a small offset between the two binaries planes. The point: the planar photon structure is missing a spatial dimension that is present in the conservation mechanism of the triple binary energy core. Therefore, the photon's options are limited when it comes to preserving momentum under acceleration. It would make a lot of sense if it shed energy of equal and opposite momentum to match the shift due to transverse acceleration (Cherenkov radiation). If this branch of the NPQG thought experiment is correct, then this is entirely sensible. Self-referentially, it is both reinforcing and promising when the emerging model reveals sensible, parsimonious, consistent physical mechanisms.
