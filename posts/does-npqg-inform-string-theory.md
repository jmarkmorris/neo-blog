We might think of each point charge path as a never-ending string, but I don't know if that has any mapping to string theory. Since I'm touring geometries lately, let's take a quick look.

> _In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string._

Well, that definition shows there is no direct mapping from NPQG to string theory. However, it is possible that the geometry of string theory may be adaptable. Here are some ideas for a transformation.

| **String Theory Misconception** | **Point Charge Remedy** |
| --- | --- |
| "_the point-like particles of particle physics_" | It looks like through some combination of experimental limits and/or quantum mechanics uncertainty principle misconception that the term "point-like" is used in the definition as a euphemism for the standard matter structures for which physicists have effective theories describing these structures quite well.      Nevertheless, there really are point like objects and they are describable parsimoniously as point charges with a magnitude \|e/6\| and they move continuously through Euclidean space and time all the while emitting electrical fields which propagate spherically at speed @ which is the asymptote of c. Meanwhile the characteristics of the local net electric field and it's gradient continuously act upon each charge. Self action is possible when v > @.      These energetic point charges, form structure and those structures are the particles described by the standard model.      Bottom line, it could be a good sign that string theory works with point objects. |
| "_one-dimensional objects called strings_" | This needs to be changed such that the object is a point and it has a charge, which extends a string as it moves through Euclidean time and space Euclidean space and time. Thus the string always has an open end where the point is located. The history string may be considered of infinite length in Euclidean time and space.      _Aside : What is the proper mathematical terminology for an open ended string?_ I think "path" is a good term. What is the term for path generator? Self? Point? Charge? I think "charge" is a good term because it implies the current location of the point charge. Path history is the set of all past point locations in Euclidean time and space, i.e., x, y, z for all t < the present.      The worldline, or string history, of a point charge has a length or distance metric that includes time and 3D space. That makes total sense and has dualities to special relativity.      Aside : special relativity has no understanding of the implementation of spacetime aether or the photon! How amazing is that?! In retrospect that was probably another missed clue. |
| "_String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other._" | This is mappable. The language could be cleaned up to note what I said above about the business end of the string.      We also need to cover how field objects propagate through Euclidean time and space and how superposition works and the gradient of electric potential and the gradient of the gradient of electric potential. Not unsurprisingly, these relate to the Euclidean time and space position, velocity, and acceleration of the point charge. |
| _properties determined by the vibrational state of the string_ | This doesn't map. We can be far more specific than "vibration". We can use the dynamical geometry of charge paths. This apparently requires a new geometry that draws upon ideas from many previously developed geometries. |

Is it possible to simplify string theory with knowledge of the point charge universe? I found this MIT website with some great history about string theory history and players. [http://web.mit.edu/demoscience/StringTheory/index.html](http://web.mit.edu/demoscience/StringTheory/index.html)

In this video Leonard Susskind talks about string theory, its founding concepts, and current state. I found it to be illuminating and exciting.

Let's extract some of Susskind's quotes from the transcript of the video. I've edited them for clarity and brevity.

> _How \[string theory\] happened was like many discoveries somewhat accidental. You discover something in a context which turns out not to be the natural context for studying it. String theory originated as a theory of protons and neutrons and mesons._ _These are objects about a hundred thousand times smaller than an atom yet enormous by physicists standards. You can pull on them and they stretch out. The mathematics and the constructions describing protons and neutrons did a pretty good job of that incidentally._
> 
> _Nature repeats itself and on scales a billion billion times smaller and faster that same mathematics seems capable of describing physics at the Planck scale. It seems capable perhaps of describing the physics of quantum gravity. These strings have an oscillation nature to them and it's almost like a rubber band. If the rubber band didn't have friction you could imagine it vibrating forever. They are very thin and small and very strong._
> 
> _Out of the vibrations of these strings all of the particles and forces that we know can be derived. At the present time string theory is a mathematical structure which looks more like the universe of elementary particles than any other theory which contains gravity. String theory has the property that it automatically contains gravity. However, string theory has never been put together in a form which is so close to natural reality that we're certain that it's correct._
> 
> _String theory has a huge number of ways to choose the one solution so it has been exceedingly difficult to find that one solution. Where we have not made a lot of progress is unifying string theory with cosmology. My own feeling is that we are really missing some very big pieces. String theory is not the end of the story._

How do the ideas of NPQG map onto string theory and vice versa?

- Both theories are based at the Planck scale.

- String theory has different vibrating strings making each standard matter particle.

- In NPQG standard model particles are assemblies of point charges.

- Perhaps there may be a way to map point charge orbitals to string theory vibrations.

- Does string theory envision spacetime or Higgs as string based? If not, it should.

- String theory math may be mappable to NPQG, but I don't know if string theory would be the best long term to describe nature. Perhaps there is something simpler.

- I don't know what to make of the idea of extra dimensions in string theory. Perhaps they are related to the emergence of various composite particles/strings in which case they are not fundamental dimensions.

The LEGO set for the universe is an unbounded Euclidean void in time and space and energy generating and carrying point potentials.
