Once we **_remap_** the GR-QM model of physics and cosmology **_onto_** [**NPQG**](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/24/idealized-neoclassical-model/), we will have enhanced science to study existential questions about life. Let’s ponder a scenario.

* * *

Scientific inquiries into the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent life began circa 1960, resulting in the well known [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation). We have not yet seen other intelligent lifeforms in the short sliver of time that we have been observing the universe. Perhaps a signal is present, but our instruments are not designed to detect that signal. There may be no signal at all. What does our lack of detection of an extraterrestrial intelligence in the observable universe tell us about the existential question of extraterrestrial life?

How quickly can life develop and spread before it is snuffed out by an internal or external cause? What is the distribution metric for the spread of intelligent life by radius and time? What can we know? What can we model? If space is infinite or even large enough, what is the probability that one intelligent life will come in causal contact with intelligent life that originated elsewhere?

The habitable zone in a galaxy fluctuates to a large degree based upon the activity of the galactic center supermassive black hole (SMBH). In 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚, an SMBH core is at extreme temperature and pressure, perhaps culminating in a core of maximally dense point potentials. SMBH activity may include irregular breaches of the black hole core beyond the event horizon. A breach of the core via polar jets (or other mechanisms) will release life threatening gamma rays throughout the galaxy. Had intelligent life developed within the kill zone, it would be snuffed out.

Another impact of 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 is that Big Bang cosmology is replaced by ongoing galaxy local processes, i.e., the breach of black hole event horizons by spacetime plasma. Therefore the age of the universe is almost certainly much older than 13.8 billion years. The age of the universe may be infinite. The galaxy local mechanism also suggests that the size of the universe may be much larger than we imagine and may be infinite.

Intelligent life _**on**_ Earth will cease at some point in the future. Earth may be doomed to be swallowed, far into the future, when our sun becomes a red giant. Earth may experience a catastrophic collision with a killer asteroid or other wandering celestial objects. Besides external causes, intelligent life on Earth may snuff itself out via a number of potential methods (nuclear, CRISPR, global climate change, rogue Ai, lethal biological agents, etc.).

If we desire to spread intelligent life, we must make it an objective. We must send many spaceship based self-sustaining colonies to maximize survival possibilities. Furthermore we must develop technology that can carry intelligent life beyond our galaxy.
