This is a short post about an article from NASA titled "[Quasar Tsunamis Rip Across Galaxies."](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/quasar-tsunamis-rip-across-galaxies) Please read the article. I'll include quotes (fair use) and make some comments.

> Using the unique capabilities of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, a team of astronomers has discovered the most energetic outflows ever witnessed in the universe. They emanate from quasars and tear across interstellar space like tsunamis, wreaking havoc on the galaxies in which the quasars live.

What could be the root cause of these outflows?

> Quasars are extremely remote celestial objects, emitting exceptionally large amounts of energy. Quasars contain supermassive black holes fueled by infalling matter that can shine 1,000 times brighter than their host galaxies of hundreds of billions of stars.

GR-QM era physics does not correctly understand supermassive black holes (SMBH). In particular they do not understand that SMBH can form Planck particle cores.

> As the black hole devours matter, hot gas encircles it and emits intense radiation, creating the quasar. Winds, driven by blistering radiation pressure from the vicinity of the black hole, push material away from the galaxy's center. These outflows accelerate to breathtaking velocities that are a few percent of the speed of light.

Unfortunately science has failed to understand an enormous underlying cause of the outflows. They are a result of the Planck core breaching the event horizon at the poles and emitting extremely powerful Planck plasma jets which undergo inflation. It is that inflation of particles, and in particular newly formed particles of spacetime Ã¦ther that is the most powerful driver of the outflows.

> "No other phenomena carries more mechanical energy. Over the lifetime of 10 million years, these outflows produce a million times more energy than a gamma-ray burst," explained principal investigator Nahum Arav of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. "The winds are pushing hundreds of solar masses of material each year. The amount of mechanical energy that these outflows carry is up to several hundreds of times higher than the luminosity of the entire Milky Way galaxy."

"This is an illustration of a distant galaxy with an active quasar at its center. A quasar emits exceptionally large amounts of energy generated by a supermassive black hole fueled by infalling matter. Using the unique capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered that blistering radiation pressure from the vicinity of the black hole pushes material away from the galaxy's center at a fraction of the speed of light. The "quasar winds" are propelling hundreds of solar masses of material each year. This affects the entire galaxy as the material snowplows into surrounding gas and dust."

> The quasar winds snowplow across the galaxy's disk. Material that otherwise would have formed new stars is violently swept from the galaxy, causing star birth to cease. Radiation pushes the gas and dust to far greater distances than scientists previously thought, creating a galaxy-wide event.

That could be bad news for us here on Earth if Sagittarius A\*, the SMBH in the center of the Milky Way, ever erupts.

> As this cosmic tsunami slams into interstellar material, the temperature at the shock front spikes to billions of degrees, where material glows largely in X-rays, but also widely across the light spectrum. Anyone witnessing this event would see a brilliant celestial display.

> Aside from measuring the most energetic quasars ever observed, the team also discovered another outflow accelerating faster than any other. It increased from nearly 43 million miles per hour to roughly 46 million miles per hour in a three-year period. The scientists believe its acceleration will continue to increase over time.

In my opinion, the idea of the accretion disk being the primary driver of these outflows is not convincing. It seems much more logical to me that eruptions of Planck plasma that inflate would be the source of the matter-energy-spacetime inflation that would propel these tsunamis.
