#### Mass and Gravity

Other than in very dense matter-energy spacetime aether is composed of low apparent energy particle assemblies. The particle assemblies we are more familiar with such as protons, neutrons, electrons, quarks, and photons as well as the other particles of the standard model are all surrounded and permeated by spacetime aether assemblies. Every one of these particles has a neutral assembly of triply-nested orbiting binaries made of electrinos and positrinos. The electrinos and positrinos in each binary orbit, precess, or execute their wave equation depending on your preference for language. Since all particles are surrounded or permeated by neighboring particles they are all continuously interacting electromagnetically as the electrinos and positrinos in their shells move in relation to other particle shells.

Every point charge has an outstanding ability to cause action which we associate with force, which we associate with a field. The magnitude of the potential field drops quickly with distance squared. The action is determined by the shape of the expanding field stream, the location when emitted, and the velocity of the receiving charge.

The apparent energy (i.e., mass) of a particle is determined by the energy exchange of each particle with all other particles. It is a continuous superposition of potential waves which affect all point potentials they encounter, which is largely the aether particles of spacetime given their abundance. Therefore mass can be considered as the outstanding apparent energy in the universal energy bank. Gravitational mass energy waves cause spacetime particles to excite as a function of all impinging wave energy. The energy of a spacetime aether assembly is continuously refreshing as new potential waves impinge upon it and past waves move onward.

Particles experience a convective force towards higher energy aether. This is what we call gravity. The larger the energy gradient across the local aether the higher the gravity.

#### Time

Every particle experiences **time** as a function of the current geometry of its Noether core, which is related to total energy and velocity and gravitational field. Time experienced by assemblies is continuous because the electrinos and positrinos in the Noether core are moving smoothly through continuous space, not discretely jumping from position to position.

We can also speak of **absolute time**, which is an abstract concept describing the pace of time at a constant (but arbitrary) rate. Absolute time is not influenced by electrinos, positrinos, nor energy. Absolute time can not be measured or tested. However, we can choose a benchmark standard for the pace of absolute time and then determine the rate of time for each particle compared to absolute time.
