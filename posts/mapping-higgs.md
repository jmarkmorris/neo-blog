I read a popular science article and thought it would be interesting to compare with NPQG.

| 0 | Assumptions: General Relativity, Quantum Theory, and LCDM Cosmology. All of these are "effective theories" with no reductionist foundation in nature. | Findings: Circa 1900 physicists considered a single primitive model of point potentials. It was properly falsified. **_No other possibilities were considered_**! A parsimonious assembly architecture emerges from point potentials with magnitude \|e/6\|. It was overlooked. |
| 1 | "**The Higgs particle could have ended the universe by now – here’s why we’re still here**" — article title | Nonsense. What physicists call the Higgs is the point potential assembly that implements Einstein's spacetime. Those assemblies are pro and anti, triply-nested orbiting binaries of positive and negative point potentials, at vastly different scales of energy, orbital radius, and orbital speed.   These are the Noether core assemblies that comprise spacetime aether, named after Emmy Noether who did some amazing physics that relates directly to these point potential assemblies.      I doubt there is some way to create a perpetually cascading explosion of spacetime assemblies. LIkewise, I doubt there is a way to cause Wilczek's Ice-9 scenario with spacetime assemblies. Ingenuity of intelligent life may surprise me here. |
| 2 | Although our universe may seem stable, having existed for a **_whopping_** 13.7 billion years, several experiments suggest that it is at risk – walking on the edge of a very dangerous cliff. | Nonsense. The universe has no known beginning nor end, in time or space. Physicists have made interpretative errors that lead the false conclusion that the universe came into existence 13.8 billion years ago. |
| 3 | And it’s all down to the instability of a single fundamental particle: the Higgs boson. | See 1. The Noether core assembly is an assembly of point potentials. Hence, the Higgs boson is not fundamental. |
| 4 | \[...\] we show that some models of the early universe, those which involve objects called light primordial black holes, are unlikely to be right because they would have triggered the Higgs boson to end the cosmos by now. | Do Noether cores map to theoretical primordial black holes? Hmmm, that would be quite interesting and clever. |
| 5 | The Higgs boson is responsible for the mass and interactions of all the particles we know of. That’s because particle masses are a consequence of elementary particles interacting with a field, dubbed the Higgs field. Because the Higgs boson exists, we know that the field exists. | Physicists don't know the actual implementation of "mass".   Physicists think particles are excitations in per particle fields and that those fields are fundamental. This is not true. Positive and negative point potentials are fundamental, and emergent assemblies produce complex potential patterns that map to wave equations. |
| 6 | You can think of \[the Higgs\] field as a perfectly still water bath that we soak in. It has identical properties across the entire universe. This means we observe the same masses and interactions throughout the cosmos. This uniformity has allowed us to observe and describe the same physics over several millennia. | Analogies to a liquid or a gas are helpful pedagogically. Spacetime assemblies are so tiny that they permeate everything, even the volume between a fermion's personality charge and it's Noether core. Noether cores obey the Pauli exclusion principle, unless they are traveling at speeds near field speed, where they are planar. |
| 7 | But the Higgs field isn’t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location. If that happened, however, it would alter the laws of physics dramatically. | Nonsense. The Noether core assemblies of spacetime quickly reach equilibrium in any region of space. The energy content of a Noether core increases with the presence of dense standard model particle assemblies. Noether cores shrink as they gain energy and inflate/expand as they lose energy. |
| 8 | Such a change would represent what physicists call a phase transition. This is what happens when water turns into vapour, forming bubbles in the process. A phase transition in the Higgs field would similarly create low-energy bubbles of space with completely different physics in them.   In such a bubble, the mass of electrons would suddenly change, and so would its interactions with other particles. Protons and neutrons – which make up the atomic nucleus and are made of quarks – would suddenly dislocate. Essentially, anybody experiencing such a change would likely no longer be able to report it. | We need to rearrange the interpretation.   Noether core spacetime assemblies, are scalable with energy. At high energy they are tiny, approaching a Planck scale radius, then as they dissipate energy they inflate quickly and then expand from there. Each quantum step in angular momentum is associated with an increase in orbital radius and a decrease in orbital velocity.   Expanded Noether cores may be more susceptible to reaction and decay, thus producing individual point potentials that quickly become personality charges for a Noether core.      Let's be clear about the bubble. The bubbles are standard model fermion assemblies. Much smaller spacetime assemblies can flow in between the Noether core of a fermion and its personality charges. |
| 9 | Recent measurements of particle masses from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern suggest that such an event might be possible. But don’t panic; this may only occur in a few thousand billion billion years after we retire. For this reason, in the corridors of particle physics departments, it is usually said that the universe is not unstable but rather “meta-stable”, because the world’s end will not happen anytime soon. | Nonsense. See 1 through 8. We are permeated and surrounded by a tremendous amount of energy that is shielded by superposition, there doesn't appear to be anything to worry about. By the way, this also explains the vacuum catastrophe. |
| 10 | To form a bubble, the Higgs field needs a good reason. Due to quantum mechanics, the theory which governs the microcosms of atoms and particles, the energy of the Higgs is always fluctuating. And it is statistically possible (although unlikely, which is why it takes so much time) that the Higgs forms a bubble from time to time.   However, the story is different in the presence of external energy sources like strong gravitational fields or hot plasma (a form of matter made up of charged particles): the field can borrow this energy to form bubbles more easily. | Physicists are unaware of the implementation of Higgs wave equation emitting spacetime assemblies in the point potential universe. They do not know that high energy spacetime assemblies can and do emit from black holes of sufficient conditions.      If physicists understood this, then they would realize they have misinterpreted the Big Bang and that every galaxy is recycling standard matter assemblies (bubbles) and producing high energy spacetime assemblies, emitting them from black holes, where they then react and create new standard model assemblies. |
| 11 | Therefore, although there is no reason to expect that the Higgs field forms numerous bubbles today, a big question in the context of cosmology is whether the extreme environments shortly after the Big Bang could have triggered such bubbling. | Yes, new assemblies are created in large quantities in every active galactic nucleus. The concept of the one time Big Bang needs to be reframed into ongoing galaxy local processes. |
| 12 | However, when the universe was very hot, although energy was available to help form Higgs bubbles, thermal effects also stabilized the Higgs by modifying its quantum properties. Therefore, this heat could not trigger the end of the universe, which is probably why we are still here. | Nonsense. See 1-11. |
| 13 | Primordial black holes   In our new research, we showed there is one source of heat, however, that would constantly cause such bubbling (without the  stabilizingthermal effects seen in the early days after the Big Bang). That’s primordial black holes, a type of black hole which emerged in the early universe from the collapse of overly dense regions of spacetime. | Interestingly "overly dense regions of spacetime" maps directly to black holes.      Also primordial black holes appear to map directly to extremely high energy Noether cores, the triply nested set of binaries, with each binary at a vastly different scale of energy, radius, and speed. |
| 14 | Unlike normal black holes, which form when stars collapse, primordial ones could be tiny – as light as a gram.   The existence of such light black holes is a prediction of many theoretical models that describe the evolution of the cosmos shortly after the Big Bang | Noether cores are tiny. Again, this maps. |
| 15 | This includes some models of inflation, suggesting the universe blew up hugely in size after the Big Bang. | Noether cores inflate as they dissipate energy and then expand after that. |
| 16 | However, proving this existence comes with a big caveat: Stephen Hawking demonstrated in the 1970s that, because of quantum mechanics, black holes evaporate slowly by emitting radiation through their event horizon (a point at which not even light can escape). | Hawking did not know about the point potential model and how it implements the standard model and general relativity.   Hawking did not realize that high energy Noether cores can emit through black hole jets or through radial emission. Coupled pro and anti Noether cores are a high energy cousin of the photon and are not blocked by the event horizon. |
| 17 | Hawking showed that black holes behave like heat sources in the universe, with a temperature inversely proportional to their mass. This means that light black holes are much hotter and evaporate more quickly than massive ones. In particular, if primordial black holes lighter than a few thousands billion grams formed in the early universe (10 billion times smaller than the Moon’s mass), as many models suggest, they would have evaporated by now. | Black holes do emit high energy Noether cores as high energy spacetime assemblies, which inflate, expand, produce new standard model assemblies. Hawking was not aware of this and limited himself to pair production mechanisms generating "Hawking radiation". Perhaps this mechanism can be reframed to better match nature.   Noether cores do not evaporate. They pass energy and eventually reach equilibrium. You can also think of Noether core energy dissipation as redshift (see DeBroglie). |
| 18 | In the presence of the Higgs field, such objects would behave like impurities in a fizzy drink – helping the liquid form gas bubbles by contributing to its energy via the effect of gravity (due to the mass of the black hole) and the ambient temperature (due to its Hawking radiation). | This is the formation of standard model assemblies from high energy spacetime assemblies, aka Noether cores, aka bubbles. |
| 19 | When primordial black holes evaporate, they heat the universe locally. They would evolve in the middle of hot spots that could be much hotter than the surrounding universe, but still colder than their typical Hawking temperature. What we showed, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations, is that, because of the existence of these hot spots, they would constantly cause the Higgs field to bubble. | Presumably there are different regions of configuration space where the Noether cores of spacetime can spontaneously react to product new standard model assemblies, or where spacetime Noether cores contribute to a reaction involving existing standard model assemblies. |
| 20 | But we are still here. This means that such objects are highly unlikely to ever have existed. In fact, we should rule out all of the cosmological scenarios predicting their existence. | Nonsense. It is simply narrative confusion on physicists part that leads to this incorrect conclusion. |
| 21 | That’s of course unless we discover some evidence of their past existence in ancient radiation or gravitational waves. If we do, that may be even more exciting. That would indicate that there’s something we don’t know about the Higgs; something that protects it from bubbling in the presence of evaporating primordial black holes. This may, in fact, be brand new particles or forces. | Again, this is based on narrative confusion from physicists.   It seems that PBH map to pro and anti Noether cores.   Noether cores are the central nucleus of everything in the universe — every particle in the standard model including Higgs maps to a point potential assembly that has one or more Noether cores. |
| 22 | Either way, it is clear that we still have a lot to discover about the universe on the smallest and biggest scales. | The way to make progress is to reverse course to 1900 and re-evaluate all the potential point potential models. Only one very primitive model was considered at the time, and it was properly falsified. However, there are infinite point potential models, and there is one parsimonious model that fits perfectly with GR/QM/LCDM observations and theory. However, it reveals that there is a tremendous amount of interpretational and narrative confusion in the fields of particle physics and cosmology. |

This A-B analysis makes it extremely clear that rearranging the ontology as suggested by the point potential model is an excellent path forward.

A new insight arose during this differential analysis, the possibility that the concept of primordial black holes maps to the Noether cores of spacetime.

- Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that formed soon after the Big Bang.

- In the inflationary era and early radiation-dominated universe, extremely dense pockets of subatomic matter may have been tightly packed to the point of gravitational collapse, creating primordial black holes.

- PBHs have long been considered possibly important if not nearly exclusive components of dark matter, the latter perspective having been strengthened by both LIGO/Virgo interferometer gravitational wave and JWST observations.

- Many PBHs may have the mass of an asteroid but the size of a hydrogen atom and be traveling at enormous speeds

Well, it will certainly be a surprise to physicists and cosmologists that their PBH concept maps to the core of all spacetime assemblies and possibly to the Noether cores in fermions and bosons.
