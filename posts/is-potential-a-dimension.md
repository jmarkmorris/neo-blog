It occurs to me that we need to consider whether or not potential is a dimension. Let's first enumerate what our emerging model hypothesizes:

- The evolution equation of the universe operates entirely on path information of each point charge.

- Path determines the spherical potential stream of each point charge.

- Potential is a presumed to be a scalar function at all points in time and 3D Euclidean space (t,x,y,z).

- Action results from the value and gradient of the potential at the point charge's location in time and space (t,x,y,z).

- Action is calculated as the superposition of all point charge relationships in the universe, including the self.

I'm not quite sure what to make of the situation. In a very real sense, the potential is an intermediate calculation in the evolution equation. The potential could be considered to be the calculated virtual geometric medium through which the evolution equation operates. It is certainly possible to simulate nature without tracking the value of potential at every point. We only need to calculate potential along the path of each and every geometrical point charge.

_Aside: I imagine there will be an opportunity for technology startups to do research and development on optimized algorithms for what will turn out to be a wide variety of simulation use cases and requirements._

So that leads back to the original question. Is potential a dimension? In one sense a point charge moves through time and space, (t,x,y,z) and we consider those to be dimensions. If at each point in time and space, we have a potential that can vary, that seems to indicate it should be a dimension. Our virtual observer could measure the potential.

Potential insight: I question whether potential is a scalar. At any action point on a Dirac potential sphere, the information contained is both the value of the potential and the vector direction from the emitter. Note that it is not possible to calculate the radii to the emitter because the emitter's velocity factors into the initial Dirac delta potential emission.

I would welcome some insight from geometers and mathematicians.
