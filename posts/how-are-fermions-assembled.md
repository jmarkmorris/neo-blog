I was thinking about **assembly theory** (Sara Imari Walker, Lee Cronin, and their groups) and the idea of **selection**. We are used to thinking about natural selection when it comes to life forms. Yet nature implements many reaction processes that "select" for the emergent structures. Select is a more abstract word, and I think its use allows for the case where the emergent structures have no agency, they are not influencing their own outcome. Whereas with life forms we often talk about survival of the fittest, which certainly suggests agency in one's outcome. From these musings, it dawned on me to contemplate the **2-2-2-6 orbital structure** of the fermions.

It is logical to presume that the high energy processes and events from which standard matter originates must _**select**_ the emergent structures. This suggests that we might make hypotheses to explain why each structure might be selected. Of course, this all begs for new science.

- The binary selects because of classical electrodynamics including Coulomb's law leading to orbits of equal and opposite point charges, forming a binary. This basic assembly step of **structure I** is available over a wide range of energies. This structure on its own is not selected as stable in low energy environments because it is so highly reactive.

- The nested binary is assembled when a binary with lesser energy and larger radius couples with a higher energy binary or nest of binaries. A two binary nest is not selected at lower energies and densities because it does not provide full shielding and is not stable in T3D Euclidean time and space. A three binary nest shields the energy of the inner binaries thus making it less reactive and more likely to be selected. The tri-binary structure is also stable in T3D as it can adjust angular momentum in any rotation interaction.

- Now we turn to the personality layer. Six point charges. If we take an intuitive leap and imagine the electrodynamic dual of Lagrange points around a Noether core, an obvious place to look is the two polar regions of each of the three binaries. Those are six locations that may have some special property that dynamical point charge geometry will reveal as progress is made. Alternatively there could be certain orbits or wave equations that circumnavigate the six poles. Simulation will reveal the geometry although I presume there are analytical solutions as well.

In the diagram I've mapped all the fermions, including pro and anti versions, and left and right handed ones. The pattern is geometrical.

This next chart shows an overlay on a popular QED chart. Again the geometrical pattern jumps out in the point charge geometry.

The patterns in these charts may suggest some sort of tilt of the Noether core planes in response to the personality point charges. Or it could be an angular offset to the wave equations for the personality point charge orbits. The Weinberg angle is around 30 degrees. Let's enumerate the possibilities and include the charge plane angle conjecture.

| Electrino | Positrino | Charge | Charge Plane Angle (?) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 0 | \-1 | 180 |
| 5 | 1 | \-2/3 | 150 |
| 4 | 2 | \-1/3 | 120 |
| 3 | 3 | 0 | 90 |
| 2 | 4 | 1/3 | 60 |
| 1 | 5 | 2/3 | 30 |
| 0 | 6 | 1 | 0 |

Why would nature select for certain of these patterns? We have the Noether core with its amazing symmetries. We have the basic symmetries of charge (parity) and orbital direction of each of the binaries as well as the personality charges. Only the electron and neutrino appear to be stable independently. The quarks are stable in nucleons, but not independently. Then we have matter and antimatter selection. Lastly, we have some variations that have not been observed in nature. Even though we are only a few primitive assembly steps in to the world of emergent structure, there is a lot of work remaining to gain ultimate insight.

This was a brainstorm style post. It's important to study the patterns that arise in point charge thought experiments. Often they lead to new insights, better patterns, and deeper understanding.

_p.s. I suggest a new sub-category of astrophysics to study the production and selection of binaries and nested binaries throughout the various astronomical objects and events in the cosmos (i.e., planets, stars, neutron starts, black holes, supernovae, AGNs, quasars, gamma ray bursts, and kilonova.)_
