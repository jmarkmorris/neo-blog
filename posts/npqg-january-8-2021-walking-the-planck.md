Let's imagine a photon on a direct course for the Planck scale density point charge core of an SMBH. Flying in from the edge of the observable universe the photon has redshifted to lower energy. Then it passes through its final galaxies and enters its last galaxy. The final parsec. The final light year. It approaches the SMBH. It is one of many photons that have never experienced a scattering collision and it passes the event horizon with a one way ticket. As it continues inward, even though it has gained energy, it loses stability in the higher energy environment and separates into a pro and anti Noether core. Each is a structure composed of three binaries of increasing energy.

Physicists concept _of_ and terminology _for_ pro- and **_anti-matter_** corresponds to the behaviour of nested structures called Noether cores and their three angular momentum vectors at vastly different scales. Anti Noether cores have a distinct difference to pro Noether cores which you can envision by observing from the basis octant where the three angular momentum vectors are aligned with i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat. It makes a difference if the orientational correspondence is H-M-L or H-L-M — those are two distinct types of Noether core. The correspondence is not a perfect mapping because of the history of the concept of anti-matter and the associated narratives which were incorrect. The concept and terminology around anti-matter will need to be re-examined and may not make sense any more. The narrative of matter meets antimatter being 'destructive' is not correct — 'reactive' is a better term. We already work with this pattern at larger scales with ionized elements and molecules, which science knows well and has leveraged in countless processes.

The Noether core starts with a high energy orbiting binary at the inner orbit. Barring some sort of asymmetry in Planck plasma, at this stage of emergence electrinos and positrinos are equal in energy distributions. If a second binary captures the first, it typically settles at a radius far larger in scale and with a commensurate drop to lesser energy and lesser orbital frequency. Likewise a third binary is commonly found at another scale jump in radius and drop in energy, and still lower orbital frequency.

Why did the series of reactions that lead to large stable structures like protons, neutrons, and electrons favor matter over antimatter? Did they? Was it a misunderstanding of the concept? A proton has a positive weak personality layer of six positrinos. It's not a huge stretch of the QM antimatter concept to consider an electron might have an anti Noether core.

These mappings will lead to a complete deciphering of the architecture for standard matter structure. NPQG is revealing many areas of QM where sorting out and cleaning up will be required. And that is perfectly ok. It's how science progresses. It is perfectly normal for a more parsimonious theory to provide insights that lead to new discoveries and a more complete understanding.

I digress. Our original photon is now inside the black hole and has decayed into a pair of equal and opposite Noether cores, each 3 electrinos and 3 positrinos. As the Noether cores continue inward the ingestate is becoming more and more energetic. At some point, the outer binaries decay and the Generation II Noether core emerges from the nest with all their previously shielded energy. Continuing on, the conditions get too energetic for the Generation II Noether core to survive and the second binary decays and reveal the interior binary and its high energy. Ultimately this binary may itself reach the energy range where it decays and individual point charges join Planck core.
