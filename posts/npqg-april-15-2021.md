This is a brainstorm post. These are ideas to investigate as progress on NPQG continues.

I wonder if the three binaries in a generation I Noether energy core will tend to reach a resonant set of frequencies based on the nesting. What defines those resonances? How can this be described mathematically?

I've seen a number of videos about auto-resonance that makes a lot of sense. This might tie into the Koide equation. Furthermore, there is this idea of all three orbitals (wave equations, circular/elliptical planar orbits, precessing orbits) tilting and approaching the same plane â€“ as energy of the particle increases (velocity, acceleration, etc.).

Here is Steven Strogatz speaking about systems of oscillators that synchronize themselves. I think this may be important for understanding Noether energy cores.

I suspect that the three nested binaries in a Noether generation I energy core will auto synchronize. We can imagine that the electrino and positrino in each binary are orbiting each other and are following their path on the surface of the sphere defined by the binary radius (it could be an oblate spheroid in some conditions).

When the Noether energy core assembly as a group is at rest with no external fields (other than nearby spacetime aether particles), the three binaries would typically be orthogonal. Imagine each binary orbiting in a plane in the set x-y, y-z, x-z to visualize the concept. A generation II Noether energy core is missing the outer binary. A generation III Noether energy core is missing both outer binaries.

Energy increases from the lowest energy outer binary to the highest energy inner binary. When the overall assembly energy is on the lower end of the scale, the binary energies are orders of magnitude different from each other, and this corresponds to the masses of the fermions. Of course, each fermion is decorated with its personality flavor made of electrinos and positrinos.

Notice how the shielding pattern will depend on the superposition of the binaries rapidly oscillating potential fields. The radius of each binary is determined by its frequency. Then the distances between binaries determine the strength of the action which falls off with distance. Spacetime aether assemblies are exceptional at shielding energy if we are to believe the Higgs energy is internal and shielded.

The electrinos and positrinos in an isolated binary with group velocity zero, at any energy, are in a constant state of traveling past one another along two parallel lines and seeing each other's potential emissions from a prior point on the emitter's path determined by the emitter's velocity. As the energy of the binary changes in h-bar j-s quanta the radius of the binary also adjusts. This behaviour becomes more complex when we have nested binaries and precession. However, when group velocity is zero, still I presume the path of each point charges is along the surface of a sphere possibly with small assembly self-perturbations, but still the charges comprising the binary are always in a symmetric equal and opposite portion of their orbit.

Perhaps spacetime Noether core binaries might all have point potential velocities exceeding @. Wouldn't that be fascinating?! The initial amplitude of a point potential wave is inversely proportional to velocity because the potential is emitted at a constant rate. Therefore, at any given point in space, the point potential emission must be divided by the velocity. Otherwise, the path integral of total emission would be different depending on the path. This behaviour may play a role in why spacetime is so lightly interactive and how the energy is shielded. At such high orbital speeds, the emission in any delta time is distributed over a delta path. Most certainly the frequencies and potential magnitudes are far beyond what can be observed in 2024.

I think the spacetime assembly may be mis-classified as a boson. It gains it's characteristics by being incredibly small, but it is not flat like a boson.

What are the relationships of the radii in the Noether core? Since potential is dropping at 1/r and each prior binary is a neutral nucleus that is orders of magnitude smaller in radius, we can simplify. Each prior set of point potentials appears to be operating to a close approximation at the origin of the orbitals. We know that the Noether core is net neutral from a charge point of view, but charge is a poor proxy for the dynamical geometry of Noether core based assemblies. I am thinking that perhaps there is a relationship between the three radii that quickly synchronizes by transfer of kinetic and potential energy. A virtual test charge very near to a Noether core would see a fluctuating potential wave determined by the orbital paths of all the point potentials in the Noether core. Each of the three binaries creates a high frequency spiral wave of positive and negative potential. The Noether core binaries are at three distinct frequencies. The orbital axis of each binary is precessing. Our test charge is buffeted by these potential waves. The distance from the test charge to the three binaries could be estimated as r1, r2, and r3 with r1 being the inner binary. To maximize the cancelling by superposition, it seems desirable that the three wave components would often cancel when received by the test charge. This is only intuition at this point. Would that imply that sq(1/r1) + sq(1/r2) = sq(1/r3)? We also know that velocity is inversely proportional to radius. Is there also a relationship such as v12 + v22 = v32?

I have an intuition that auto-synchronization of binary energy levels is the root cause of the numerology revealed in the Koide formula about the masses of fermion generations. While I am a skeptic of numerology, I've always had a hope that the Koide formula could be related to the fundamentals structure of particles.

The Koide Formula. Like many other enthusiasts, I find it fun to look at observations that may be numerology or may be some clue about nature. As a matter of due diligence, I think it is important to examine the binary assembly and look for any correlations to Koide's formula.

This also reminds me of the equations from 't Hooft and his cogwheel gear model. I suspect the ultimate point charge dynamical geometry will be mappable to each of these theories.
