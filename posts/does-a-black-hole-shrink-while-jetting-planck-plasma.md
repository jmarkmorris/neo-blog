The Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity model informs us that supermassive black holes intermittently jet in-core Planck particles from their poles. This explains a lot about the universe. However it raises many new questions about how this mechanism functions.

Let's brainstorm!

What are the conditions that influence jet initiation? **Spin? Merger? Charge? Magnetic field? Ingestion?**

What causes the jet to stop? **Depletion of Planck particles? Containment regained (why?).**

Does a black hole and its event horizon shrink while jetting Planck particles? **It seems logical. What are the alternatives?**

How is the mass of the black hole influenced by in-core Planck particles formation and/or jetting? **Since GR does not apply in the Planck core, does it still count towards mass of the black hole?** I think Planck particles surrounded by other Planck particles can not transmit their mass nor be gravitationally influenced by other mass. Therefore as matter-energy joins a Planck core, it disappears gravitationally.

How do black hole mass changes impact galaxy dynamics? **It seems logical that mass disappearance would have an effect on galaxy rotation curves.**

Answering these questions via reverse engineering or science will require more research. This initial post is to plant a flag for further thought experiment, modeling, mathematics, and insight. Please contribute your ideas in the comments.

Cheers!
