The 2020 ESO **H0** Conference objective was to discuss the wide range of measurements of expansion in the universe, embodied in a number that science currently calls the Hubble Constant **H0**, and the discordance with the ΛCDM model. The program is here and the videos are on YouTube : [http://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2020/H0/program.html.](http://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2020/H0/program.html.)

Adam Riess gives a good overview of where H0 science is stuck today, but the approach the scientists are taking is incorrect but they are unaware because they operate from false narratives due to the false priors of particle physicists. Desperately trying to find **_concordance_** with ΛCDM, a one time inflationary big bang and a constant expansion rate model, _will NOT work because there was no one time Big Bang and spacetime expands in place, not outwards in the universe._

These scientists are not facing facts. They put forth extraordinary effort to find a path towards concordance. Yet they are constrained by their existing model that they have no degrees of freedom. They are locked into an intellectual dungeon of their own creation.

To make real progress, the narrative must be reset. A picture is worth 1000 words. If you reframe from a one-time inflationary big bang narrative into a set of parallel intermittent galaxy local inflationary mini-bangs then you will resolve H0 tension and so much more!

Natarajan and Rees decided to presume that galaxy-center supermassive black holes (SMBH) fit into LCDM including the one time inflationary Big Bang. Listen to the podcast of Natarajan on Strogatz : [The Joy of X : Priya Natarajan](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2020/02/07/the-joy-of-x-priya-natarajan/).

These scientists did not consider that their newly discovered object, the SMBH, at the galaxy center, a sink for a massive amount of matter-energy, could instead be a physical implementation of the previously conceived inflationary Big Bang. If you consider AGN or SMBH the physical implementation of the inflationary big bang then it is a parallel, intermittent, galaxy-local phenomenon.

The answer is so very simple. Galaxy local processes supplant the idea of a one time inflationary big bang. The SMBH in the active galactic nuclei can occasionally mini-bang and disgorge what it has ingested in jets with a pure Planck plasma form. This plasma then reacts and one of the products is spacetime particles which inflate to make the 'quantum vacuum' the 'aether' or what I have called 'spacetime æther.'

Photons that make it to our instruments without having scattered, will have traversed a path through spacetime aether with ample variation in spacetime aether assembly energy, whether that comes from passing near a rock or a star or a galaxy. In general spacetime aether assemblies expand in volume as their energy gradient declines with radius from a galaxy. All of this variation, plus fluctuations in the potential aura presumably effect the rate of photon redshift. There is also the possibility that intra-cluster aether assemblies reach such a low energy that they start to contract again. We simply don't know enough yet about the variety of aether behaviour to understand the observations of various Hubble rates.

In point charge theory there is no Hubble constant. Redshift varies with conditions in the spacetime aether.
