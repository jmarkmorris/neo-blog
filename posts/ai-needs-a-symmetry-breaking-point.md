Might the point potential model indicate the way to a promising basis for AGI? I think so.

- The point potential binary assembly upon which nature is based and powered may have a close relationship with field speed, which is the symmetry breaking point for a binary.

- This may be a nonsense idea, but my intuition says that Noether cores are constantly rolling the dice as a result of superposition around the symmetry breaking point.

- I suspect the Generation II binary may balance upon field speed @.

- The slightest bit over, one way of the other, there are different forces.

- This is the primal symmetry breaking point of the point potential binary, now coupled to a smaller high energy binary and a larger high energy binary in a Noether core.

- A cellular chip architecture could track the paths of all reactants and influencers.
    - Optimization of the most relevant standard model assemblies and reactions
        - assemblies with 12 point potentials, each an eightball (q, t, s, s').
        
        - high energy assemblies of spacetime, the Higgs Noether core clusters.
        
        - photons, i.e., contra-rotating point charge tri-binaries.
        
        - neutrinos, i.e., wobbly photons? Binaries not planar. Oscillating with spin 1/2.
        
        - W's and Z boson interactions, mesons
        
        - and so on through some threshold
        
        - beyond that I tend to thing Ai makes sense,

- In terms of simulation efficiency, I think the goal is for Ai to start moving up the food chain where it can match or beat the GPU chip calculation with reasonable accuracy.

- An enabling technology is the ability to track point potential paths.
    - This is an enormous simulation market space with many promising niches

The main idea in this short essay is that if one of the binaries in a Noether core essentially rides on the knife edge symmetry breaking point, that somehow this leads to randomness, uncertainty, and free will. It is highly speculative, but I think this mechanism may be essential to life including intelligent life.
