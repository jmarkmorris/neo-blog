Let's learn about globular clusters and brainstorm the ontology in the point potential universe.

> A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that are tightly bound together by gravity. These clusters can contain anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of stars. They are not galaxies themselves but are found within galaxies, typically in the outer regions known as the galactic halo.
> 
> Globular clusters are among the oldest known objects in the universe, containing some of the earliest stars formed in a galaxy’s history. For example, our Milky Way galaxy has over 150 known globular clusters.

Anton ties all these ideas into the standard narrative of big bang and reionization

> The exact process of their formation is still not fully understood, but there are a few prevailing theories:
> 
> **Early Formation:** Globular clusters are thought to have formed early in the history of the universe, around the same time as the galaxies themselves. They likely originated from large clouds of gas and dust that collapsed under their own gravity.
> 
> **Galactic Halos:** These clusters are typically found in the halos of galaxies, which are the extended, spherical regions surrounding the main disk of a galaxy. This location suggests they formed before the galaxy’s disk settled into its current shape.
> 
> **Multiple Star Formation Episodes:** Some globular clusters show evidence of multiple generations of star formation, indicating that they may have experienced several bursts of star formation over time.
> 
> **Capture of Smaller Galaxies:** Another theory suggests that some globular clusters might be remnants of smaller galaxies that were captured and absorbed by larger galaxies.

In the point potential universe ontology, the Big Bang transforms into galaxy local mini bangs, i.e., processes that produce the CMB in any given region of the most distant observable space.

Are globular clusters the result of spacetime emissions from the SMBH or perhaps any BH of suitable conditions in the galaxy?

It would be cool if it this tied to Arp's intuition. There is so much unknown, I find it sad when intuition and creativity get squelched by the mainstream and its accepted offshoots. There are so many good ideas, each covering one tiny patch of the quilt that describes our universe.

> Black holes can absorb matter and energy without a strict upper limit. However, the rate at which they can do so is influenced by several factors, primarily governed by the **Eddington limit**. This limit represents the balance between the gravitational force pulling matter in and the radiation pressure pushing it out. When the accretion rate exceeds this limit, the radiation pressure can halt further accretion.
> 
> In practical terms, black holes can absorb matter at rates that can sometimes exceed the classical Eddington limit due to various factors like relativistic beaming and the structure of the accretion disk. There is no theoretical upper limit to the mass a black hole can accumulate, as long as there is sufficient matter available in its vicinity.

**Area of Investigation**: Are there are some conditions of a BH or SMBH that lead to a unidirectional non-polar jet/vent/eruption/volcano of extremely high energy pro and anti Noether cores with extreme stealth and outbound velocity? We don't know the various types of these events nor their characteristics. Let's brainstorm some possible conditions to consider:

- Narrow beam of pro/anti Noether cores that burn through lower energy spacetime Noether cores in their path,
    - possibly leaving a trail of standard model particles, high in photons and neutrinos.
    
    - possibly terminating in a dense and reactive region characterized by highly energetic Noether cores which becomes a globular cluster
    
    - The beam of pro and anti Noether cores also produces high volumes of high energy spacetime that proceeds to inflate.

- A directional burp or volcano of pro and anti Noether cores, perhaps ejected by a large BH reaching a limit, such as the Eddington limit.

- A unipolar jet from a BH?

- Can globular clusters be correlated to any BH in the vicinity when the cluster formed?

Any of these scenarios would cause a highly concentrated emission of pro and anti Noether cores at or near Planck scale which will rapidly inflate when interacting with lower energy Noether cores of spacetime. They will also participate in reactions that produce the protons, neutrons, and electrons that will later fuel stars.

> A new star, or a protostar, primarily consists of hydrogen and helium. Here’s a breakdown of its composition:
> 
> **Hydrogen**: About **73%** of the mass of a new star is hydrogen.  
> Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron.  
> In the core of the star, hydrogen nuclei (protons) undergo nuclear fusion to form helium.  
>   
> **Helium**: Approximately **25%** of the mass is helium.  
> Helium atoms typically have two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons.
> 
> The remaining 2% consists of trace amounts of heavier elements like lithium, beryllium, and boron.  
> The composition changes over time as nuclear fusion in the star creates heavier elements in its core.

This is the first time I have considered globular clusters. Globular clusters don't have a central black hole. Hence a key question is "How do globular clusters form?" In the point potential universe, there are several reasonable alternatives to consider that are consistent with NPQG.
