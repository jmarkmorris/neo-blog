I wrote a comment in response to this YouTube video, which I will include below.

@[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjVVUbIhwPM&t=805s) when Janna starts 'dispelling myths about black holes' — I differ strongly with Janna that when she says black holes are not dense, that they are empty, that they are in some sense nothing at all. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Look, it is all so simple. All you get in the whole universe is 3D Euclidean void space (not Einstein's spacetime) and two types of particles : equal and opposite, charged, energy generating and carrying, immutable, point charges. There are two free parameters in the universe. 1) the density of the point charges (presumably a 50/50 distribution) and 2) the energy density carried by those point charges. Those point charges make everything, including spacetime aether. The orbiting binary is the most primitive assembly.

Now think about what that simple premise means in a supermassive black hole. That immutability condition on the point charges is going to do a lot of heavy lifting. When the density of point charges reaches its maximum, at the Planck energy — that is where the shrinking of spacetime stops. That is the phase change to solid Planck point charge core. One microstate. No relative spin to each other (although the core may be spinning as a whole). No local kinetic energy. Zero temperature. This is the ultimate battery in the universe. One microstate means no entropy.

The energy of the Planck point charges in a Planck core is largely shielded due to superposition. Thus it appears that a black hole will hide some or all of the mass of ingested matter-energy. Perhaps this may have something to do with galaxy dynamics. So to counter Janna - the black hole core is ultimately dense and ultimately non-empty of matter and energy. Information is destroyed.

The really beautiful part of this theory is that while all the physicists are doing amazingly complicated and intense things, they are actually trying to figure things out the hard way. The physicists and cosmologists are in a crisis because there are false technical priors followed by a string of major interpretational decision points that were wrong. It is difficult for scientists to even imagine what I am saying. However, if you will suspend disbelief and just spend some time with the idea, hopefully it will click and once it does, it becomes rather obvious. I mean we have these huge jets coming out of galaxy SMBH for long periods and its pretty clear that the galaxy is recycling, and once you realize that spacetime is an aether of point charge assemblies then you see that the jet is bang/inflation and the driver of expansion from spacetime dispersal of energy.

I already wrote in another comment that you still get to keep universe wide expansion. It's just that its galaxy local and into one another! How many galaxies are on the observable surface layer of the universe that you were looking at with Planck and BICEP2? What if each of those galaxies is like a giant furnace occasionally burping out plumes of new spacetime and standard matter via their SMBH. It's gonna look a lot like remnants of a Big Bang -- and actually it is compatible with theory, because the Big Bang theory does not require that it happened at a single time nor place. In fact scientists wave their hands and say it happened all over. I am offering you a physical implementation of bang/inflation/expansion happening all over, forever.

@19:45 Janna tells a fascinating story about Einstein not believing in black holes. It will be really interesting for historians to study what Einstein knew and when. I wonder how strong the case is that he figured out how the universe works, i.e., the point charge solution. Could he have actually figured it out and then masked the solution to the universe in this idea of spacetime as a geometry, which is such an abstract imaginative concept? It was unheard of at the time.

Could Einstein have anticipated that it was too dangerous in that era in world history to reveal the theory of everything? Remember Einstein wrote seminal papers on Brownian motion in 1905 and 1908. I can very easily imagine Einstein turning his attention to immutable point charges and their motion at various energy levels. How assemblies would emerge as opposites attract and form orbiting binaries. The more energy, the tighter the spin, the shorter the radius. What is the limit? Planck scale? He may have arrived at that idea in the 1905-1910 timeframe.

I am usually not a believer in conspiracy theories, but I do know that it is very difficult to keep a secret with more than two people. So if Einstein had figured it all out, then could he have never disclosed the true discovery and instead released the mathematics that describe the behaviour of the spacetime aether? I also think that Mileva was still quite influential and perhaps doing a lot of the heavy lifting for Albert at that time. I'm not claiming Einstein discovered the solution to the universe, but I think it is possible and that it would be interesting for historians to investigate. They would also need to examine other curiosities such as how Einstein reacted to QM and of course EPR.
