The mass of a point particle is Planck's constant **h** J⋅s divided by the speed of electromagnetic field propagation squared. This is logical because it is the Planck mass divided by the Planck frequency that corresponds to the mass increments. Each Planck's constant **h** J⋅s represents one full rotation of a point particle in a binary.

Each point charge senses the direction of the electric field to be from where its partner was when it emitted the electric field along the chord of the planar orbit, labeled **tau** in this figure.

N.B. Reality is continuous for length, energy, and time. The tau binary implements quantization of these dimensions. The one-half Planck's constant **h** J⋅s uncertainty represents the tipping point where reality is mapped to the quantum binary. Now we know what we need to do to measure finer than one-half Planck's constant **h** J⋅s. We also realize the true implementation of quantum mechanics uncertainty.

Besides being a battery, variable clock, stretchy ruler, and all its other functions, the binary is a memory and an add/subtract accumulator with upper and lower bounds. This is all implemented with two point charges! Can you imagine the computational and memory density!? Each binary implements a 143 bit counter for energy! This will far surpass ‘quantum computing’ in the future.

The next steps are to learn how all the standard equations are implemented by the point charge binary. We can also gain insight from the Planck units which are a partial set of high and low operational limits on the binary. We can complete the set of bounds now and organize them.

We can modify the standard equations to improve their model of the binary behavior. Mainly it appears we need to find the permittivity and permeability of any point in space as a function of electromagnetic field strength. There are also point charge immutability factors.

If a orbiting point charge binary is left undisturbed it will never decay. Undisturbed means in a Euclidean void of time and 3D space it would spin forever at the conserved energy level. This shows that the second law of thermodynamics is incorrect. The energy of a stable point charge binary is an integer number of Planck's constant **h** J⋅s plus or minus a real component less than one-half Planck's constant **h** J⋅s.

This is an emergent law of nature that applies to fermion generations. It appears that all Generation I fermions have cores consisting of three orthogonal point charge binaries. It appears that the less energetic binaries shield the mass-energy of the inner binaries.

The path forward looks straightforward. Everything will reveal itself. It’s very simple actually. The universe is a void 3D Euclidean space with energetic immutable point charges swirling around forming and recycling structure.

I may have gained insight into the Koide formula. It appears to be related to the field couplings of three orthogonal binaries. The sum of pairwise couplings divided by the sum of each three way coupling. It is as if the electron, muon, and tau are all present. How can that be? Putting thinking cap on.

Are these the masses of three binaries in an electron and the outer binary shields the energy of at least the next smaller binary? **Wow**. Here is 3 electrino, 3 positrino Noether core of the electron, which becomes the muon and tau as the outer binaries decay. Who knew? Abundant energy?

Fields are described by a vector magnitude at each point of action. It doesn’t matter where the emitting point charge IS at the moment of action. It matters where the field emitting charge WAS when it emitted the field that arrives at the point of action.

I haven’t mapped this behaviour to information yet. Each binary is similar to a 143 bit accumulator. Each Planck's constant **h** J⋅s increment causes a change in radius of the binary. Is an Planck's constant **h** J⋅s considered one bit of information? The binary is essentially a battery that stores its frequency \* Planck's constant **h** J⋅s energy.

I’m working on the equations for the binary. It appears that it is a control system with tipping points corresponding to Planck's constant **h** J⋅s \* (n + 0.5). So as work is done to energize the system, each incremental Planck's constant **h** J⋅s causes a tension that guides the charges to the next smaller radius.

We have only learned the mass of the muon by studying high energy reactions that cause the Gen I electron binary to decay. The muon has a two binaries in its core. It would be stable in a high energy environment that could provide the third dimension of containment.

Likewise, we have only learned the mass of the tau by studying high energy reactions that cause both the Gen I and II binaries to decay. The tau has a one binary. It would be stable in a high energy environment that could provide two dimensions of containment.

The electron/muon/tau have six personality electrinos. If we remove the personality charges we get the Noether core, a nested tri-binary.

There is only one variable for a binary and that is energy. Energy determines radius, point charge velocity, length scaling, and time scaling. The Koide formula has led to the discovery of the containment _architecture_ for standard matter particles.

I presume the three orthogonal point charge binaries play a role in conservation. Do some composite particles implement containment with complex potential waves that physicists describe as wave equations? I bet so. It’s a matter of creation reactions and decay reactions. It is [Conway’s game of life](https://t.co/8QY1zaZlkf).

The universe is a perpetual energy and point charge system. The density of point charges and the density of energy on all scales of locality leads to emergence of structure. The galaxy is the dominant large scale structure that implements the main recycling network of reactions. There are larger scale galaxy clusters but they appear to be galaxies naturally gravitating into groupings that flow and mix.

Galaxies recycle energetic immutable point charges from near zero energy to Planck energy and back again with an enormous network of emergent structure forming & decay reactions with a variety of reaction products. Macro reaction process chains can span large ranges of scale.

Galaxy clusters appear to result mostly in mergers and births of new galaxies and organizing space into filaments dense with galaxies as well as reducing the density in large regions. Are there larger scale structures and how do they map in to the network?

Scientists : Point charges are immutable which is even better than conserved. You can now precisely count them in reactions to find missing low energy inputs or outputs our instruments can not yet detect. You can also use these new conservation laws in theory or simulation.
