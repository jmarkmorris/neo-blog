The home page is a textbook dedicated to emergent nature and the point charge universe. This solution to nature is called **Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity, NPQG.** The textbook explains the implementation of nature as well as how nature maps to general relativity and quantum theory. The textbook covers how nature works from the point charge perspective from the smallest to the largest scales in distance, time, energy, and assembly. A number of new, logical, and exciting solution are conjectured for the most significant open problems in physics and cosmology.

This gallery shows some important elements of NPQG. You can find more easy to understand concepts and diagrams at [New Physics inÂ Pictures](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2021/06/15/new-physics-in-pictures/)
