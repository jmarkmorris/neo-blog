This is a very brief post, because I don't have the time, at the moment, to explore a deeper mapping between the point potential universe and CKM. The most important aspect of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix is that it maps between **generations** of **_"unique standard model particles"_**. It should be immediately clear based on how NPQG explains all standard model particles assemblies that the CKM matrix is referring to the Noether core. I will keep this simple and post some info about both CKM and the Noether core, the emergent tri-binary assembly of point potentials.

It describes the mixing between the three generations of quarks when they interact via the weak nuclear force. Essentially, it is a 3x3 unitary matrix that contains information about the probability amplitudes for a quark of one type to change into another type through weak interactions.

It's eminently clear from that matrix that there is a mapping to the Noether core, which is essential to every standard model assembly.

The factors in the matrix clearly map to the idea that the binaries in a Noether core are separated by orders of magnitude in energy, radius, and frequency. My expectation is that Noether cores self-tune to stable configurations for the assembly they support. Thus, the CKM matrix would presumably map to the frequencies of each binary in the reaction.
