##### 1.     INTRODUCTION

A neoclassical model of nature is proposed for thought experiments, based upon two equal and opposite fundamental particles. These particles may also be considered as either discrete immutable point charges or as conserved immutable excitations.

This model is derived from thought experiment and re-interpretation of modern physics and cosmology. 

##### 2.     MODEL FOUNDATION AND CONJECTURE

The model is described affirmatively as conjecture. Where interpretations differ from modern physics and cosmology, the mapping is explored, and a foundation is established for further study.

###### 2.1.  Electrinos and Positrinos

The model is based on two oppositely charged electromagnetic particles, the **electrino** ε- and **positrino** ε+, each with charge magnitude |e/6|. These point charges are indestructible, carry energy, and compose standard model particle assemblies. At extreme high energy, standard matter, including that in the spacetime æther, decomposes into a plasma of electrinos and positrinos.

###### 2.2.  Planck Plasma Emits/Jets from Black Holes

In a black hole of sufficient energy and conditions, such as an active galactic center SMBH, ε- and ε+ particles are the decomposition products of high energy decay of matter-energy. At very high energy, ε- and ε+ form a Planck plasma that emits via jets from each AGN SMBH. Planck plasma can escape the black hole, most likely under high spin situations with intense frame dragging the poles of the SMBH where the point charge plasma defeats the event horizon created by the point charges in the black hole.

###### 2.3.  Planck Plasma Decays to Standard Model Particles

As ε- and ε+ plasma, in AGN SMBH emissions or jets, decays via conservative transactions, clusters of ε- and ε+ particles combine to become standard model matter-energy particles. The mapping of ε- and ε+ to key standard model particles is as follows: neutrino 6ε-/6ε+, electron 9ε-/3ε+, up quark 4ε-/8ε+, down quark 7ε-/5ε+, neutron 18ε-/18ε+, proton 15ε-/21ε+.   

###### 2.4.  Emitted Planck Plasma Inflates and Reacts as it Cools, Creating Standard Matter, Including a Universe Permeating Spacetime Æther

As Planck plasma cools, it clusters into composite particles such as spacetime æther, neutrinos, photons, and other standard matter.  The spacetime æther implements the characteristics of general relativity and is the aether underlying quantum mechanics (aka quantum vacuum) and is the carrier of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. 

###### 2.5.  Gravitational Wave Energy Excites the Spacetime Æther

Matter-energy interacts electromagnetically with local spacetime æther to exchange gravitational waves, which spread through the spacetime æther at the speed of light. This “mass” energy of the continuously refreshed gravitational wave excites the spacetime æther. The local energy gradient of the spacetime æther causes a convective force on standard matter-energy, aka the force of gravity.

###### 2.6.  Physics Parameters Run with Spacetime Æther Energy

Elevated spacetime æther energy increases its permittivity **ε** and permeability **u**, reducing local speed of light, and causing refraction commonly attributed to gravitational “lensing” around dense matter. Increasing permittivity and permeability influence standard matter, including spacetime æther, electromagnetics, resulting in matter compaction and time dilation as described by general relativity. Physics “constants,” also including the fine structure value, can be understood as the low temperature asymptote of these variables. 

###### 2.7.  Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics describes interactions of standard matter, without describing ε- and ε+ and the spacetime æther nor Planck plasma. Thought experiments based on the toy model may inform future research on quantum mechanics.

###### 2.8.  Galaxy Rotation Curves

Galaxy rotation curves are ascribed to dark matter in modern astrophysics. In the neoclassical physics model, there are a number of effects that influence galaxy dynamics and will require reconsidering galaxy physics.

First, mass energy is eliminated when matter is deconstructed to constituent ε- and ε+ particles in active galactic SMBH cores as the phase change to plasma occurs. Elimination of matter will directly influence the gravitational attraction of the SMBH on galactic matter.

Second, the emission and jetting of plasma and the subsequent decay and cooling produces new galaxy dynamics. One dynamic of note is outflowing spacetime æther. The spacetime æther does interact at very small scales of action. The inflation and expansion of spacetime æther likely has some influence galaxy rotation curves but the degree is unknown.

Third, new matter produced by plasma decay will also influence the galaxy dynamics. Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant products. It is expected that this will contribute to new star formation. Furthermore, some of this newly formed matter may be destined to cycle through the SMBH repeatedly.

Fourth, spacetime æther is composed of particles of matter-energy. While in low gravity environments spacetime æther particles are extremely low mass and energy. However, in the presence of dense matter-energy the spacetime æther heats up and this causes the spacetime æther to increase its participation in gravity.

###### 2.9.  The Shape of the Cosmos

In one variant of the model, the extent of spacetime aether is infinite, or so large as to be considered infinite from the perspective of scientific observation. 

###### 2.10.Cosmic Recycling

There is a cycle of matter-energy being reduced to ε- and ε+ Planck plasma in a galactic black hole, emission/jetting of ε- and ε+ plasma, spacetime æther formation and outflow, plasma decay into standard matter-energy, and a journey back to a galactic black hole to be recycled as plasma. This cycle does not require a big bang nor an ever-expanding universe. As a result, science must, at least for the time being, view the age of the universe as unknown.

#### 3.     APPLYING THE MODEL

###### 3.1.  Low Energy Particle Zoo

Aside from extreme energy conditions, in the temperate zone outside of stars, black holes, jets, and colliders, there are five particles typically found in nature at the scales we can currently measure. These are the photon, proton p, electron e\-, neutron n, and neutrino v.

The photon, has the formula 6ε-/6ε+. 

Equations conserve electrinos and positrinos. The anti-electron, aka positron, has a formula of 3ε-/9ε+.  Matter and anti-matter balance perfectly.

The anti-neutrino has a formula of 6ε-/6ε+. The neutrino also has a formula of 6ε-/6ε+.

###### 3.2.  The Extreme Energy Particle Zoo

In stars, black holes, jets, colliders, and perhaps other reactions, high energy can lead to a number of exotic \[n\]ε-/\[m\]ε+ particles. Many of these are described by the standard model although the electrino/positrino formulation is missing from the physics. Detailed data on many particles is found in the PDG listings (Tanabashi, 2018). Some decay modes are missing production or consumption of spacetime æther particles.

###### 3.3.  Reactions that Consume or Produce Low Energy Photons and Neutrinos from Spacetime Æther

The modern physics formula for beta\-decay is: 

n = p + e\-+ !v

However, that formula does not balance electrinos and positrinos. The model predicts the following correction:

n + Higgs = p + e\-+ !v

We see that this decay reaction consumes a Higgs, which is a low apparent energy particle of spacetime aether.

A number of other reactions have been found to be missing the expression of low energy spacetime particles in the reaction formulas. A list of several found follows. The derivation is straightforward.

1. Hydrogen fusion into Deuterium in stage one of Hydrogen Helium fusion in starts up to ~1.3M⊙.

3. CNO cycle in stars over   ~1.3M⊙requires a spacetime æther input to the 13N to 13C reaction, as well as to the 15O to 15N reaction.

5. In the bottle vs. beam experiment, there may be another reaction case. This decay mode would be counted in the bottle experiment but missed in the beam experiment. This may explain the discrepancy.

7. The LLNL and NIF are pursuing deuterium and tritium fusion which will produce helium, an anti-neutrino and a photon.

9. Of course, pair production from the quantum vacuum is consuming one or more particles from the spacetime æther.

11. Pi0decay modes 1 and 6 produce a photon, while decay mode 4 consumes a photon.

#### 4.     NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF NATURE

The neoclassical model thought experiment leads to many speculative, but seemingly logical new interpretations that may solve many open problems and issues in physics and cosmology.

###### 4.1.  Origin and End of the Universe

The neoclassical model suggests that AGN SMBH which jet or emit Planck plasma forming spacetime Higgs aether, accomplish, in long cycle concurrency, what has previously been described as a single big bang. An examination of the big bang timeline appears to be roughly compatible with this jet process. For example, inflation would correspond to the behaviour of the emergent Noether core tri-binary structures in superluminal plasma jets. Since general relativity does not apply to the Planck plasma, superluminality is possible. This new interpretation of a recycling universe will obscure the true age of the universe. How long has the universe cycled? Does the cycling ebb and flow such that the proportions of standard matter particles and energy fluctuates over time or space?

###### 4.2.  Distances, Redshift, Curvature, Spacetime Æther

The neoclassical model provides a physical medium of spacetime æther to implement Einstein’s special and general relativity and the curvature of “spacetime”. The causes of redshift around dense matter can now be seen to be related to the gravitational energy of the spacetime æther, and to be due to variable permittivity and permeability of the æther which changes the speed of light. Furthermore, on a universe scale, outflow of spacetime æther would also cause redshift. This may indicate that distances are not as far as have been calculated by modern astrophysics.

###### 4.3.   Parity and Charge-Parity Symmetry

With the inclusion of the electrino and positrino particles and the understanding of the composition of spacetime æther, observed violations of symmetry will need to be re-examined. Perhaps symmetry may be preserved after all when all of the reactants are considered.

###### 4.4.  Reduction of Speculative Physics and Cosmology

The neoclassical model appears to lead to a reset to a many hypothesis in physics and cosmology. No big bang. Singularity = phase change. No wormholes. No MWI. Complete re-evaluation of dark matter and dark energy models. Outflow vs. expansion. No imbalance of matter and anti-matter. No supersymmetry. No holographic universe. No extra dimensions. Each of these areas was addressing a problem that has a more straightforward path to an answer with the neoclassical model.

#### 5.     RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

A tremendous amount of research is required to improve the toy model and its implications for the interpretation of nature. The nature of time and how it is influenced by the characteristics of spacetime æther is not yet understood. How do spacetime æther particles in reaction assume roles of W, Z, and H bosons? How do high energy photons navigate the spacetime æther? How to improve general relativity around the extremes of energy where phase change and decay influence behavior. How do large gravitational waves propagate in the spacetime æther? These and many more questions are open. 

#### 6.     SUMMARY

A parsimonious neoclassical model of nature is proposed where the electrino ε- and positrino ε+ are the basis of all matter, the carriers of all energy, and photons and neutrinos form a spacetime æther which permeates most of the universe. At high energies matter and æther change phase to plasma wherein general relativity does not apply. Neither general relativity nor quantum mechanics include the electrino, positrino, nor a material spacetime æther. The neoclassical model informs solutions to many open problems in physics and cosmology. A new narrative emerges that requires recasting and reframing the interpretations of experimental results and theory from physics, cosmology, and astronomy.
