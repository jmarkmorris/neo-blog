I am building a model to explore the idea of **Einstein's spacetime as a physical aether** of neutral particles that are composed of equal numbers of fundamental electrinos and positrinos. In most of the universe this aether has very low apparent energy and is very lightly interacting.

> _It is ironic that Einstein's most creative work, the general theory of relativity, should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise \[in special relativity\] was that no such medium existed \[..\] The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. . . . Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry. \[..\] It turns out that such matter exists. About the time relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether. But we do not call it this because it is taboo._

The NPQG model leads to the following insights, which will be explained in more detail in subsequent posts.

1. ⁠Vacuum expectation and pair production :: reaction product of spacetime æther into photons and standard matter-energy.

3. ⁠Galaxy rotation curves ::  
    a) concentration of denser, more excited spacetime æther,  
    b) matter-energy accumulation in Planck cores inside supermassive black holes (SMBH) which shields energy from participation in gravity, and  
    c) emission/jetting of Planck plasma creating a spacetime æther inflation and expansion outflow.

5. Inflation :: Planck plasma jet or mini-bang from SMBH causes inflation.

7. Photon :: photons pass through spacetime æther while experiencing galaxy local aether expansion, which results in redshift.

9. Mass :: Lossless exchange of apparent energy between matter-energy and spacetime æther, manifested in a potential energy footprint of gravitational waves around matter-energy.

11. Gravity :: energy gradient in the spacetime æther.

13. ⁠Cosmological redshift :: Galaxy local expansion of spacetime æther causes photon redshift. Note that galaxies expand INTO each other.

15. Gravitational lensing :: refraction due to permittivity and permeability change in high energy spacetime æther.

17. ⁠Curved spacetime æther :: due to dynamical contraction and dilation of spacetime æther particles as well as their permittivity and permeability change as a function of spacetime æther energy density.

19. Experiments and narrative attributed to a one time inflationary Big Bang :: this is recast as the Planck point charge plasma emission from an SMBH Planck core via breach of the event horizon and emergence as a Planck plasma jet.
