I've shown mathematically that an **_isolated point charge binary_** implements asymptotic safety. This begs the question of what is happening in a Planck core at the most extreme density of point charges and energy. It's certainly not at all like an isolated point charge binary!

The geometry and dynamics of isolated orbiting point charge binaries leads to immutability through self action when point charge speed exceeds the speed of its own electric field. This begs the question of the behaviour of a dense collection of point charge binaries at frequencies nearing the Planck frequency, such as might be found in a supermassive black hole with sufficient conditions. How does such a dense collection of point charges behave and can it be shown to implement immutability?

I have imagined that a Planck core of an SMBH could reach the state of maximally packed FCC or HCP lattice of point charges with a sphere of immutability. The lattice could have defects such as open locations or irregular arrangements of point charges. How does a Planck core implement immutability and is that mechanism different than the immutability implemented by orbiting binaries?

It is important to drill into the minimal, most parsimonious formulation of nature via intense scrutiny of all the corner cases of NPQG and then feed those findings back into the point charge model. We need to explain every asymmetry and corner case, including the right hand rule.

What are the states just preceding the formation of an interlocked Planck core with zero relative entropy and complete loss of information, not considering defects? I imagine elastic vibrations as binaries or individual charges "collide" through close range interactions of kinetic energy and electromagnetic potential energy.

What are the theoretical dynamics of a Planck core? This is an entirely solvable problem via mathematics and simulation. Are there any ranges of conditions correlated with SMBH Planck plasma jet events? Do any of the emerging geometries relate to unexplained aspects of the standard model, for example, the fine structure constant and why it runs with energy?

This revisitation of the Planck core concept entered through my subconscious while I was working on formulating the simple math of an isolated point charge binary in Euclidean space and time. After pondering the Planck core conundrum subconsciously, it has now occurred to me that an isolated point charge binary is not a natural situation in my formulation of the point charge universe model. It could be that the tri-binaries are only formed under very special situations and that the very structure of the tri-binary is what makes it stable and a survivor among a sea of other point charge structures.

If am correct that the middle binary corresponds to the gen II fermion energy engine and the inner binary corresponds to the gen III fermion energy engine then we already know that those are unstable particles, i.e., highly reactive. While it is important to continue to attempt to describe the ideal isolated point charge binary, I am also thinking that true insight may require simulation of a density of point charges at arbitrary velocities above and below their own field speed.

If that is what our universe is made of, then I really don't know what kind of precise math would be used on a collection of energetic point charges moving at some velocity v and emitting fields continuously from each point in their history. I mean it is kind of unprecedented mathematically isn't it? It would be a branch of math where at every continuous moment there are discrete points in R4 with PE and KE that are both emitting fields and being acted upon by incoming fields from themselves and all other point charges. That's not your normal integral. Is there a branch of mathematics for such a thing?

p.s. I'm also thinking it would be incredibly cool to seed an Ai with a huge number of point charge neural net inputs and use the latest techniques available, i.e., beyond backprop towards GANs, and state of the art techniques. You could start simple by giving the neural net inputs properties like charge or Maxwell's equations. However, I bet it will be possible some day to use an Ai to deduce everything from the observables.
