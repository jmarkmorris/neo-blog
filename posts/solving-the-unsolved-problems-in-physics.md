There are many previously [unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics) which are or will be solved using the Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity model. I've written blog posts about the NPQG solution for many of these problems. On this page, I provide a summary and link to each solution.

| Previously Unsolved Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **Baryon Asymmetry**   Where is all the anti-matter? | [Anti-Matter Mystery Solved!](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/16/anti-matter-mystery-solved/) |
| **Physical Information**   Can information be destroyed? | Nature destroys information in the black hole recycling process.   [Nature Destroys Information](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/29/nature-destroys-information/) |
| **Cosmic Inflation**   Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct? | Inflation is a ongoing and intermittent galaxy-local process that occurs when Planck plasma is emitted from supermassive black holes.

| **The Hierarchy Problem**   Why is gravity such a weak force? | Gravity is caused by an ebb and flow of energy between standard matter-energy and spacetime aether.   [Unifying the Four Forces](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/17/unifying-the-four-forces/) |
| **The Planck Particle**   Is there a fundamental particle with mass equal to or close to that of the Planck mass?    | A volume of Planck particles can occur in the core of a supermassive black hole. Planck particles in a Planck core can not transmit mass nor participate in gravity, because the electromagnetic fields of their constituent electrinos and positrinos are shielded via superposition.

| **The Arrow of Time** | Time is in some sense a measure of particle energy. At Planck energy, time is stopped. As a particle sheds energy time goes faster. At zero energy time is non-existent.   [Fresh Thinking on Time](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2019/06/14/fresh-thinking-on-time/)      Entropy is conserved.   Entropy is zero in a Planck particle core.

| **Dark Matter** | NPQG provides several new mechanisms to explain galaxy rotation curves and the other observations that seek dark matter as a solution.       1.     Spacetime æther is composed of particles of matter-energy. In low gravity environments spacetime æther particles are extremely low mass and energy. However, in the presence of dense matter-energy the spacetime æther gains energy and this causes the spacetime æther to increase its participation in gravity.   2.     Matter-energy consumed by galaxy center SMBH will cease to participate in gravity if and when it joins a Planck core, as is present in SMBH under certain conditions.   3.     Upon a Planck core breaching the event horizon, and Planck plasma jetting, inflating, decaying, and reacting as spacetime æther, photons, neutrinos, and other standard matter-energy and the reappearance of mass above and below the galactic plane.   4.     The inflation and decay of Planck plasma jets also generates a tremendous amount of new spacetime æther and this may also impact galaxy rotation curves.

| **Dark Energy** | Dark energy is caused by the æther that implements spacetime. The inflationary/expansionary flow of æther away from SMBH is a factor in dark energy as well. |
| **Magnetic Monopoles** | They do not exist. Magnetism is caused by moving point charges. |
| **Relativistic Astrophysical Jets** | Emitting Planck plasma from the core of an SMBH is a source of relativistic astrophysical jets.

| **Horizon Problem**   Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the Big Bang theory seems to predict larger measurable anisotropies of the night sky than those observed? | NPQG solves this problem with galaxy-local mini-bang and galaxy-local mini-inflation/expansion that uses the same physics throughout the universe, thus requiring no causality solution to the horizon problem. The Big Bang and one-time cosmic inflation theories are transformed to galaxy local processes in NPQG. |
| **Origin and Future of the Universe** | NPQG defines a quasi-steady-state recycling universe with conserved point charges and energy. The origin and end of the universe are unknown in NPQG. The future is more steady state recycling. |
| **The Size of the Universe** | NPQG is compatible with an infinite universe. |
| **Measurement and Wave Function Collapse** | A measurement involves an energy transfer. For energy to transfer from a particle, the wave function must switch from one solution to another. This is incorrectly called a "collapse" when it is simply a transition between wave equation solutions. This is a routine process for the Noether core of a point charge structure. |
| **The largest structures in the universe are larger than expected.** | The universe age is unknown in NPQG and likely much older than previously thought (13.8 billion years). With an older, possibly infinitely old, universe there is time for large structures to evolve. In the new era these structures may be a clue to establishing a minimum age of the universe. |
| **Extra dimensions** | There are no exotic dimensions in NPQG. Space is three dimensional. Time is defined per point charge assembly based upon it's Noether core frequencies, is one dimensional, and can not go backwards. |
| **Weak and Strong Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis** | Both the strong and weak cosmic censorship hypotheses are false, because the event horizon of black holes can be breached in a collision or in powerful jets thus exposing a 'naked singularity' which NPQG calls a Planck core. We do observe powerful polar jets from SMBH, but GR-QM era physics ascribes this to accretion flow whipped up by magnetic fields. While it may be possible for accretion disk material to flow this way, I predict that the main driver of the jet is a breach of the event horizon and jetting from a Planck core. I hypothesize that the 'singularity' is a artistic narrative of Einstein's equations reaching an infinity—and is physically akin to a phase change of matter-energy as energy and other dimensions approach Planck scale. |

As development of NPQG continues, I expect that more solutions to the unsolved problems in physics will reveal themselves.
