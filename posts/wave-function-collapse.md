Quantum mechanics includes the mysterious behaviour called **_collapse of the wave function_**. Let's see if we can decipher this enigma with the help of Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (ùó°ùó£ùó§ùóö). First, some background.

Let's parse that, break it down, spell it out, deconstruct, and **_understand_** what is happening. Physicists often whine about not being able to measure position and momentum at the same time because of wave function collapse. Those same physicists know that they can not take a measurement without changing the energy of the system being observed. The mechanism physicists call wave function collapses, or we might say **transition**s, _**whenever**_ particle energy changes. It is a totally normal thing. Being 'observed' is just one meta method of energy transfer and it's a generic transaction as far as the particle is concerned.

Furthermore, energy is conserved, so the **wave function transition** (ne. _collapse_) between wave function solutions, loses no energy, nor information.

What does "superposition of eigenstates" mean? I think this means a superposition of energy harmonics that tally the energy of the particle. I think that eigenstates in this case, are harmonics, and that every particle is a harmonic oscillator. The wave function solutions implement the set of all possible energy states. It appears to me that the wave function operates as a debit/credit accountant. The first harmonic is the Planck energy and that only occurs in Planck particles in a Planck core or Planck plasma. It's turtles all the way down from there, trading energy in quanta of various denominations. I don't know yet what is the lowest quanta, but it should be clear that particle energy can go to near zero apparent energy. TGeneral relativity applies ONLY between the extremes, not at the extremes.
