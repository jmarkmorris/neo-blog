In this post, we'll go through an Alan Guth cosmology lecture and show how to transform the **ΛCDM** narrative of cosmology into a sensible model of reality using NPQG.

While you watch this video, use the following translation table to transform the lecture into the NPQG cosmological model, which is far more parsimonious, sensible, logical, and more than likely very close to the truth.

| Guth / **Λ**CDM Terminology | NPQG Mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Universe (when speaking of bang, inflation, expansion, etc.) | There are several concepts in LCDM that are applied at a universe scale that should rightly be applied at a galaxy scale since that is their origination : bang, inflation, expansion. |
| Pocket universes | Galaxies |
| Multiverse | Observable universe containing billions/trillions of galaxies |
| Age of universe 13.8B years. | There is no known age of the universe and it is possibly infinitely old with no beginning. |
| Negative energy | This may correspond to shielded energy in an SMBH Planck core that while inside the Planck core is not counted on the mass accounting ledger, yet is entirely conserved, and reappears in a galaxy local mini-bang/inflation event via the SMBH jets. |
| Eternal inflation | Parallel and intermittent galaxy local mini-bang/inflation events      Each galaxy may have ongoing and intermittent such events. |
| Universe expansion | Galaxy local expansion.   Galaxies expand INTO one another |
| Gravitational repulsion | I think this is related to the mechanism that breaches the event horizon of the SMBH. My guess is that it is a combination of SMBH size, spin, frame dragging, and a vortex that forms both deforming the event horizon and allowing lower energy spacetime æther to get near enough to trigger the jet. |
| Hubble tension | Galaxy local expansion.   Hubble rate is expected to vary. Hubble to be rebased as a distance measurement based on maps of galaxy local expansion. |
| Omega (flat, open, closed)   Omega measured as 1 to high accuracy. | Omega = 1 because foundation is Euclidean time and space and spacetime æther is a sea emergent point charge assemblies. |
| Accelerating universe      5 billion year point for accelerating universe.       | Galaxy local expansion   Ultimately the acceleration part is related to a difference in instrument readings. New science is required to reconsider this in the galaxy local process. |
| Negative pressure | Inflation of Planck plasma in SMBH jet followed by continuing expansion of spacetime æther until encountering the opposing expansion from neighboring galaxies. |
| Dark energy   vacuum energy | Energy originating from Planck core or other high energy events that creates new spacetime aether assemblies and new Noether cores and drives galaxy local mini-bang/inflation/expansion. |
| Dark matter | Particles comprising spacetime æther that gain energy around concentrated matter-energy. |
| Energy density constancy during inflation, despite increasing volume | Driven by 'off the ledger' energy reservoir in SMBH Planck cores and shielded energy in Noether cores. |
| Quantum vacuum | Spacetime æther |
| No shortest wavelength in QFT and resulting divergence.      Cutoff at Planck scale.      QFT estimate of vacuum energy 120 order of magnitude off. | Cutoff at Planck scale.      QFT vacuum calculation matches the energy density calculation for a Planck core.      See [Planck Core Energy](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2020/02/14/planck-core-energy/)      This solves the cosmological constant problem. |
| The popular egg model with protruding funnel of Big Bang / inflation is wrong because Big Bang / inflation was everywhere. | Everywhere = billions/trillions of galaxy local minibang/inflation processes.      The 'egg' model is fairly close to correct - the simple correction is that the egg is the Planck core of the SMBH in an active galactic nuclei and that we need two funnels, one for each jet emerging from the poles of the SMBH. |
| Big Bang / Inflation does not explain precursor of particles that emerge. | NPQG teaches that electrinos and positrinos are conserved and that they are supplied to the mini-bang / inflation event from the Planck core of an SMBH. |
| The standard inflationary big bang theory includes a timeline of what happens when, starting with some very small time scales. | This is the timeline from a Planck core breach and traces the history of the Planck plasma jets. |
| Large scale uniformity in the universe.      CMB variation 1 part in 100,000. Isotropy. | Billions/Trillions of galaxies in observable universe going through a similar process that starts with a Planck core. A Planck core has 1 microstate (not counting faults, etc.). So all of these processes have essentially the same starting point. |
