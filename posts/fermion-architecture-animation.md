Backstory: My hobby is working on modeling nature and the universe with equal and opposite point charges in flat time and space, i.e., Euclidean. I considered both general relativity and quantum mechanics as reference observations & matching theory that must map to and from a point charge architectural candidate.

Well, it turns out science failed to imagine a rather simple architecture in the period 1875 to 1925. So, if the animations don't look like anything you've ever seen before, that's because it was skipped over unknowingly, and science moved forward into a very challenging and difficult 125 years of sometimes glacially slow advancement on the foundations of nature. The lack of foundation is what causes general relativity and quantum mechanics to be so complicated and perplexing. The point charge architecture falsifies many incorrect narratives in the ontologies of particle physics and cosmology.

I'm currently at the stage of beginning to animate the architecture and the assemblies of point charges that emerge. It's dualistic to Conway's Game of Life, with a ruleset that includes continuous R4 with path history and delayed action. The ruleset also allows a point charge to exceed the speed of its own potential emissions.

The text in the video model describes behaviour that I intend to animate over time. The animations are already helping me find new insights I hadn't considered before. In parallel I am working on simulation of the architecture to learn the conditions under which each type of assembly develops and its range of stability.

We'll learn the exact conditions for everything in the standard model. With this architecture there is no technical barrier to point charge level simulation of any reaction. We'll also be able to develop incredible new technologies that leverage the knowledge of the architecture to find the controllable reactions that lead to an abundance of resources, all done safely.

In terms of math, there is only one ultimate equation. It is an evolution equation for a dynamical geometry. It is fairly easy to express in short form as a summation over all pairs of point charges in the universe, sometimes including the self. That said, there are emergent mathematics that describe assembly behaviour and reaction behaviour under myriad conditions. I am also working on mapping the point charge architecture to the mathematics and theories of physics.

The premise is that scientists of 100 to 125 years ago, had a failure of imagination during the classical to quantum transition. They only seriously looked at a single very primitive point charge architecture mapping q to the proton and -q to the electron, with the speed limit on q being c. That model was properly falsified. However, there are many other point charge architectures that one can dream up and I've found one that appears to map extremely well to general relativity and quantum theory.

This animation covers the fermion architecture and illustrates how it works and why. If you can imagine the enormous electric potential tsunamis at these radii and energy levels then you may understand why the architecture is so amazing. For example, there are 12 point charges in every standard model fermion, each following its own path according to a single universal evolution equation. Yet it turns out that point charges form assemblies. The animation shows you how the generations of fermions work. It also shows why color charge exists only for the quarks and why there are three "colors", aka geometries. I didn't yet show pro and anti assemblies, nor left and right spin, but all of those are variations on the geometry shown. Everything in the universe is based on a dynamical geometry of electric potential emitting point charges, the action of emitted potential upon point charges, and the resulting paths that those point charges follow.

In this video I've rotated the "camera" around each assembly so you can get a better idea of how it works. There are three binaries in the core, at vastly different energy, radii, and velocity. Each binary produces two polar vortices, and these are where the personality charges get bonded.

On the to do list are animations of the photons and bosons which reuse a lot of the architecture and sub-assemblies shown here. Also, I plan to start showing some of the basic reactions and trace the provenance (path) of each point charge in the reaction. The reactions between assemblies of point charges are the root basis of Feynman diagrams.
