The science of black holes will need major revisions for the NPQG era. The extremes of energy and density we call a black hole are most certainly a domain where structures are ephemeral and reactions dominate. The pre-NPQG theory of black holes is dominated by Einstein's general relativity and extensions from that basis based on ideas of an event horizon where photons can not escape, ideas about "no-hair" and other theoretical ideas with no basis in natural implementation. Yet, presumable at some energy level even photon assemblies are not stable. On top of that science doesn't yet understand that the photon is an assembly that sails on the potential field of its constituent point charges in a nested contra-rotating coaxial structure. General relativity describes an extremely wide energy range for a mix of Noether core based assemblies, but it does not cover the case where even the Noether cores are highly unstable.

Consider this: there is no known natural limit on unit potential point charge velocity other than via energy transferring interactions. However, if a high-speed point charge were to be launched in a reaction, it would probably not travel far before a cumulative set of interactions and reactions with the spacetime aether assemblies would cause it to react and form one or more lower group velocity assemblies. That said, the high velocity point charge may still be captured in an orbiting binary structure, but that is a local velocity.

The theory of black hole event horizons and photons is revealed to be quite different than previously understood. There is no existing science that yet contemplates individual point charges or small group assemblies traveling at velocities greater than a photon in the conditions at an event horizon. Does the concept of event horizon itself make sense in this new era? Point charge theory proposes a structure to photons, i.e., contra-rotating point charge tri-binaries that travel at the speed c given by local permittivity and permeability, which themselves are due to potential flow geometries and also encode some portion of Einsteinâ€™s general relativity.

Black hole science becomes even more complex because it is now possible to model and simulate precisely with the source code of nature in hand. I suggest that a general principle will be that the higher the energy in a region the lower the average assembly number of the point charges in that region. What is the ultimate state? Is it point charge binaries spinning around each other in a dense plasma? Does there come a point where a phase change occurs and point charges solidify with little to no relative movement?
