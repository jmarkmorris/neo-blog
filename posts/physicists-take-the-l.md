_Dr. Stacy McGaugh made a post "[Divergence](https://tritonstation.com/2021/07/08/divergence-2/)" on his Triton Station blog. I responded with this rather pleasant rant although I don't know if it made it through the filters :_

Here's an idea to consider. The most face-saving idea for everyone is to press the rewind button. How far back you want to rewind is a matter of your own views, but at least go back before the terms dark matter and MOND were coined! Simply agree that the choice of ontologies and frameworks is likely impeding the science. To convince dark matter folks, point out that the really deep physicists like Wilczek are no longer thinking about spacetime as a geometry. They are starting to open the door in their thinking to an aether. I listen to so many of these interviews that I don't have a reference, but just listen to recent Wilczek social media and read his latest book. Now, if their roiling quantum, pair producing, vacuum is really an aether, then we have a whole 'nuther (**Noether!**) ball game. That means all the astrophysicists' photons are traversing an aether like spacetime, which is described by Einstein's geometry at a macro level, but at the lowest level has an assembly architecture.

I would press the rewind button back much farther, as I trace a dozen major failures in the decision history. I learned of one today, "**bootstrap**" and it is a whopper:

> Geoffrey Chew and others went so far as to question the distinction between composite and elementary particles, advocating a “nuclear democracy” in which the idea that some particles were more elementary than others was discarded.
> 
> Wikipedia

Imagine that, they decided NOT to look for fundamental particles. The scientific method does not address this kind of crisis.

Today, I listened to a Dr. Sean M. Carroll podcast and his tortured, confused, misunderstanding of spacetime, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. It's such a tragedy that our best and brightest minds are so confused about nature. Until today, I didn't realize how deeply the bad interpretive code has influenced Sean's programming. I had thought it was confined mainly to the **_many world's nonsense_** that Sean has been advocating to his readers, viewers, and subscribers. It is far deeper and insidious.

This is not about Sean. He is certainly a good, kind, and highly intelligent person trying to live his best life, like most of us. Despite Sean's tortuous explanations I do learn a lot about how GR/QM/LCDM era physicists think about nature. That is very informative. Often, they have great insight albeit shrouded in wrong interpretation. It's a matter of introducing a cognitive transformation to map their vague understanding to what most likely is happening to the point potential reality of nature and the universe.

I have listened to many Sean M. Carroll podcast on my walks. Sean is excellent at explaining the tortured interpretations of GR, QM, and LCDM era physics and cosmology. It feels like listening in on a confessional. I take no glee or solace in saying that.

Let the physics and science historians do the back-tracking to try to understand the provenance of each interpretational error. As a hobbyist I've traced at least a dozen errors and they seem to network to each other. Nature is such a symmetric house of mirrors it is easy to see how so many theories have vestiges of the truth of nature.

Science must also address the fact that the scientific method must be updated to self-detect false prior situations or crisis gaps in progress. Think about it, 50 years of no major progress, and I argue 150 years off track narratively! The scientific method failed several generations of scientists! The intellectual and financial waste is enormous! We could have had the keys to nature by at least 1920. We are behind schedule by at least a century. We must learn that when research slows, in what should otherwise be a fertile area, it is time to re-examine priors and probe assumptions. **_Why were point charges discarded so easily?_**

To what degree was physics intentionally diverted off track? See my post about [Heisenberg and Bohr.](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2021/12/06/bohr-and-heisenberg-plasma-ten/) Surely **_someone_** could have had the creativity to take the ideal point charge and give it some characteristics to overcome any concerns about self-energy or annihilation. Even today this is a good project for an undergraduate electrical engineering or physics major. It is not a complicated problem. We know a lot about the ultimate results of the emergent descriptive math.

I have produced the first periodic table of particle physics. It turns out that immutable point charges are useful for solving a bunch of other issues as well, for example we know there aren’t singularities, but now we know why, and can predict that densely packed point charges (in the core of some black holes?) have one microstate, and zero entropy, zero temperature, and zero information (ok, maybe you could argue 1 bit of information).

The scientific method does not address this failure case of its own method! 

> _As a result of physicists veering so far off track interpretively, while having an effective theory with high precision, which is not really that big of a deal it turns out, they dove into mathematics head long, and now use intense mathematics as the gate code to the_ _**walled garden of precise but interpretively wrong physics!**_
