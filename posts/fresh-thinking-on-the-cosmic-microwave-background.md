There are many previously [unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics) which are or will be solved using the Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚) model. In this post I'll discuss **the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**.

> The cosmic microwave background (CMB), in Big Bang cosmology, is electromagnetic radiation as a remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as "relic radiation". The CMB is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space. It is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination. With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise, or glow, almost isotropic, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson\[1\]\[2\] was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.

As you can see from the quote above, physicists have tightly wed the measured cosmic microwave background (CMB) to the Big Bang theory. Yet in 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 there is no Big Bang, and instead there are many intermittent and ongoing galaxy-local mini-bangs of Planck plasma, including galaxy-local inflation, and each of these events roughly follows the timeline of the Big Bang hypothesis.

Furthermore, physicists play fast and loose with the definition of the “vacuum,” where in some cases it is considered as mostly empty spacetime through which photons transit unimpeded and in other cases it is a roiling quantum vacuum. Let’s see if NPQG can provide a better explanation.

First some facts:

> The CMB has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.7 K.
> 
> The CMB redshift, Z, is thought by scientists to be about 1090.
> 
> WIKIPEDIA  

Physicists believe the CMB is radiation is from the “early times” and has redshifted so much that it has a redshift of 1090, which is 100 times more than any radiation redshift we have seen from any other object or event. They believe that at emission, about 380000 years after the Big Bang, the CMB photons had a temperature of around 3000 K.

In 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚, the products of a Planck plasma jet or mini-bang are Planck neutrinos and Planck photons which experience rapid inflation and reactions and cooling over time. If we apply the timeline science has hypothesized, then about 380,000 years after Planck particles eject from the Planck core, the ejecta will have spread and cooled to the point where photons can escape en-masse and depart the active galactic nuclei and/or the accumulation points of plasma in jet knots and termini.

Eventually the photons cool through collisions, including the galaxy local expansions traversed on the path, until they reach what appears to be a steady-state. The 2.7 Kelvin black body spectrum of the CMB corresponds to the black body radiation spectrum of cold æther. Those æther particles have yielded their original Planck energy in a series of transactions until each æther particle is nearly tapped out of energy\*.

Lastly, note that GR-QM era physicists utilize a single one-time inflation mechanism to explain the isotropy of the CMB. In 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 there is _no need for causal connection_ of the universe where variation in the cosmic microwave background is 1 part in 100000. With galaxy-local micro-bangs and galaxy-local inflation, we have a Planck process, **governed by the same physics**, throughout the universe. Furthermore, there appears to be some natural steady state where the æther eventually cools to a 2.7 K average\*\*.

\* Note 1: Even though each individual particle in the æther averages a very cold temperature of 2.7 K, there are so many particles per unit volume that if we can learn how to tap into the æther it can be the ultimate resource for energy and matter.

\*\* Note 2: We have an open question in NPQG regarding the velocity of spacetime æther particles.
