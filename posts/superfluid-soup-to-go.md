In January 2018 I began developing a model and narrative of nature that now surpasses general relativity, quantum mechanics, and modern physics in its understanding of nature. I aimed at parsimony, with an intuition that Maxwell's equations might rule over all and that Einstein's spacetime concept might be based upon a physical æther of particles.

One concern was the force of gravity. I simply did not believe gravity was a force at a distance through a vacuum, even a roiling quantum vacuum.

The universe is permeated by an æther of point charge assemblies that implement Einstein's spacetime. All matter is bathed in the energy, of the æther — you, me, earth, stars, and matter up to the extremely high energy levels where even æther decays into its constituent binaries. Standard model matter excites the æther and this energy then causes the æther to physically contract towards higher energy and expand towards lower energy. Likewise the frequency of the orbiting binaries in the aether also increases with energy. Our measurements of distance and time are based upon photons we observe. Let's think about photons traversing high energy aether nearby high apparent energy matter.

- Photons are emitted with a power spectrum determined by the reaction, where by power spectrum I mean the net photon energy production rate per frequency range. Note that individual photon energy is a function of frequency. This is then factored into the photon production rate per frequency range.

- When virtually observed from the absolute Euclidean frame of time and space, photon speed is slower in extreme energy æther and photon orbital frequency is higher. As the photon traverses from higher energy æther near the reaction towards lower energy æther in spacetime, the photon redshifts away energy to the inflating and expanding aether and its frequency and energy decline. The photon speed increases as the energy of the aether declines.

As point charge plasma dissipates energy and decays, the point charges assemble and emerge as standard model particles, with various behaviors partially described in the Particle Data Group documentation.

Standard matter exchanges energy with local spacetime æther assemblies, causing the spacetime æther energy to increase. In a mechanism similar to an AC current the energy is passed along in a wave. Standard matter-energy experiences the force of gravitation towards higher energy spacetime æther according to the steepest energy gradient.

Maxwell’s equations rely upon the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of space. Contrary to popular belief, permittivity and permeability are **NOT** constants. They vary based upon spacetime æther energy.

Spacetime æther gains energy as a function of the density of nearby matter. To enable the increased energy storage, the permittivity and permeability of the spacetime æther increases. This causes the effects theorized by general relativity such as curvature, refraction (lensing), gravitational redshift, space contraction, and time dilation.

Closely packed Planck scale point charges can form in the core of a supermassive black hole. Under some conditions the Planck core may emit via jet or rupture. This standard-matter recycling process via the galactic center SMBH is one of several new galaxy dynamics that may be a cause of galaxy rotation curves.

Planck plasma emits near Planck energy and the SMBH jets may extend several megaparsecs. The high energy jet produces dynamic reactions under a variety of conditions as the jet inflates and cools, producing particles of standard matter as well as new spacetime æther.

It's fascinating how photons flow and curve through the spacetime æther at local speed of light **c**, which is constant in the pseudo-Riemannian coordinates of the æther, but is in fact variable in the Euclidean geometry of fundamental space and determined by local permittivity and permeability which are a function of spacetime æther energy.

The emission of Planck scale point charge plasma from the AGN SMBH causes rapid inflation which drives galaxy expansion. The expansions of neighboring galaxies oppose one another and the intergalactic media is typically found at 2.7K, which is the temperature of the CMB. The decay of spacetime æther particles in the outer neighborhood of each galaxy is the last reaction that provides the balance of outflow of æther with the infall of matter-energy. Another convection cycle begins.
