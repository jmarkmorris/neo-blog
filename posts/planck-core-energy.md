Let's estimate the energy contained in a cubic meter of Planck point charge core. I imagine a Planck core in a supermassive black hole as an arrangement of spherical electrino and positrino point charges packed as tightly as possible, i.e., at the maximum curvature radius. This is a sphere-packing problem, and there are two well-known ways to pack spheres in the densest arrangement. These are called face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packing (HCP).

The volume packing density is given by the formula $latex \\mathbf{\\frac {\\pi }{3 \\sqrt {2}}} &s=2$.

Let's presume that each Planck scale electrino and positrino is a sphere with a radius of the Planck length, $latex \\mathbf{L \_{p}} &s=1$, which is $latex \\mathbf{1.6 x 10^{-35}} &s=1$ meters. The volume of a sphere is given by $latex \\mathbf{\\frac {4}{3} \\pi r^{3}} &s=2$.

How many total Planck particles are contained in a cubic meter of Planck core? It is the volume of the cubic meter (length x width x height) times the density of the lattice divided by the volume of a Planck particle.

$latex \\mathbf{particles = \\frac {1^{3} \\frac { \\pi }{3 \\sqrt {2}}} {{ \\frac {4}{3} \\pi L\_{P}^{3}}}} &s=3$

$latex \\mathbf{particles = \\frac {1} {4\\sqrt {2} L\_{P}^{3}}} &s=3$

Each Planck particle carries the Planck energy, $latex \\mathbf{E \_{p}} &s=1$, which is $latex \\mathbf{1.956 x 10^{9}} &s=1$ joules.

So we estimate the energy of a cubic meter of Planck core as $latex \\mathbf{\\frac {E \_{p}} {4\\sqrt {2} L\_{P}^{3}}} &s=3$.

If we plug in our constants, this results in $latex \\mathbf{8.2 x 10^{112}} &s=1$ joules.

How does the energy of a cubic meter of Planck core compare?

|  | Total Energy (Joules) |
| --- | --- |
| A cubic meter of Planck core | $latex \\mathbf{8.2 x 10^{112}} &s=2$ |
| Universe (science estimate) | $latex \\mathbf{4 x 10^{69}} &s=2$ |
| Sun | $latex \\mathbf{1.2 x 10^{44}} &s=2$ |

We can presume that current scientific estimates of the energy in the universe are way off because science has not considered several large categories of energy: a) spacetime æther itself, and b) that the cores of dense black holes do not fully participate in gravity. However, the energy contained in a true Planck core is extremely large. The open question is then whether massive black holes truly develop a Planck core, or if the core is simply at such high energy and pressure that, under the proper conditions, it can breach the event horizon at the poles or in a massive collision.

Interestingly, there is a precedent for the value $latex \\mathbf{10^{113}} &s=1$ joules, but it has been calculated as the the energy density of a cubic meter of vacuum!

> Using the upper limit of the cosmological constant, the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be $latex \\mathbf{10^{-9}} &s=1$ joules per cubic meter. However, in both quantum electrodynamics (QED) and stochastic electrodynamics (SED), consistency with the principle of Lorentz covariance and with the magnitude of the Planck constant suggest a much larger value of $latex \\mathbf{10^{113}} &s=1$ joules per cubic meter. This huge discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem.

GR-QM era science does not understand that spacetime is composed of matter-energy particles which form a spacetime æther almost everywhere in the universe. And without understanding that spacetime is a construction of matter-energy particles, they of course fail to realize that spacetime æther has an energy and temperature. At the highest temperature of spacetime matter-energy, this æther changes phase into a Planck particle core at $latex \\mathbf{10^{113}} &s=1$ joules per cubic meter. Perhaps the cosmological constant problem is solved by realizing that spacetime is an æther with varying energy, and that the two estimates of vacuum energy are at vastly different temperatures.
