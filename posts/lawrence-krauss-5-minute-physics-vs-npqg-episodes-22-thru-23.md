Dr. Lawrence Krauss posted a fascinating series of "5 Minute Physics" videos circa April/May 2020. They are filmed in and around his Oregon home, which is in a lovely woods with a creek running through it, and this yields a very pleasing viewing experience. In this post I'll review Dr. Krauss's videos and compare and contrast **NPQG**.

**Episode 22** : Dr. Krauss talks about the "Big Questions" in physics. He says that physics proceeds in baby steps and often we don't even know that a big development has been made until later. This is certainly the case with NPQG where it is has been extraordinarily difficult to get the attention of scientists. Here is Dr. Krauss's list of big open questions.

- What is dark matter?

- What is dark energy?

- Are there extra dimensions in nature?

- What are the physics of black holes with regards to paradoxes and singularities?

- Will quantum computing be practical?

- Does gravity unify with the other three forces of nature?

- What is the physics beyond the standard model?

- Is our universe unique?

NPQG answers almost all of these questions. In the case of quantum computing it is quite apparent that NPQG will lead to incredible computational capacity as NPQG based technologies are developed and eventually far more capable than what is envisioned by the current view of quantum computing.

The last question, about whether our universe is unique is open in NPQG. Certainly there is no reason to believe in other dimensions and there is every reason to believe that the universe is incredibly large and possibly infinite. NPQG does teach that if there are any voids on some grand scale that other regions of spacetime æther made of point charges would have the same physics that we observe in our universe, unless the density of point charges and energy were significantly different, as might be the case if we are actually in some grand Monte Carlo simulation, which is unlikely in my opinion.

**Episode 23** : Dr. Krauss talks about how the scientific method eliminates nonsense by illuminating ideas that do not match with scientific observation and evidence. While this is true, it is also true that GR-QM-_Λ_CDM era physics and cosmology have established interlocking layers of narratives that are **pure nonsense** themselves. Let's list a few of these nonsense ideas:

- the idea that nature is entirely based on fields and no point charges to generate the fields or be acted upon

- the idea of an expanding universe

- the idea that the Hubble rate is a constant

- the idea that the Hubble rate tells us galaxies are receding

- the uncertainty of whether the universe is open, closed, or flat

- the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years

- the idea that SMBH jets are entirely from the accretion disc

- the idea that mass is fundamental

- the idea of renormalization

- the idea that the Planck units do not correspond to physical nature

- the idea of the quantum vacuum and virtual particles

- the idea of singularities

- the idea of wormholes

- the idea of multiverses

- the idea of extra dimensions in nature

- the idea of many worlds

- the idea that spacetime is a pure geometry

- the idea that information can not be destroyed in a black hole

- the idea that entropy is not conserved

- the idea of a one time inflationary Big Bang

That is a partial list of GR-QM-ΛCDM era nonsense.

Dr. Krauss then discusses the concept of uncertainty in physics. I find this to be ironic as well, because physicists have such high confidence in the certainty of their body of work that they are incredibly reluctant to question the tower of babbling nonsense they have placed on top of their observations and evidence.

I hope the readers who make it through these videos and my responses will appreciate Dr. Krauss's series as well as see how the GR-QM-ΛCDM era will be supplanted by NPQG.
