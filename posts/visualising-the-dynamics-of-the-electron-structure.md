I've attached a primitive visualization conjecture for a fermion structure in the point charge model. When opposite charges orbit as a binary, there are fascinating implications, especially when you also think about distance and frequency (time) scales. The electromagnetic fields at most locations near a binary are fluctuating rapidly as the opposite charge sweeps through 1/2 a revolution after its partner charge. The changing potential along the axis of the orbit is a vortex.

Imagine the three binaries in the core of the fermion are orbiting at radii far below what experimentalists can observe directly. Just for example's sake, let's say radii of orbit at 10^-32, 10^-28, and 10^-24 meters. From the perspective of an outer binary, the next inner binary is four orders of magnitude away (in this example). The opposite charges of each binary cancel out, so there is this net neutral object at scale 0.0001 and it is throwing off a strong magnetic field and also alternating electric field. Then pop out to the outer binary. The inner binary is now 8 orders of magnitude smaller in radius of orbit, .00000001.

Now consider that each orbit also has an angular momentum vector, orthogonal to the orbital plane, described by two angles and a magnitude. Would it be possible for those three angular momentum vectors to oscillate and precess while still conserving momentum? Would the three binaries interact and possibly harmonically synchronize their frequencies? Where would the six low energy personality layer point charges like to orbit in their wave equation? Are they circulating in the vortices? What if the basis vectors of the three orbital planes were aligning due to the fermion moving at high velocity?

If you model an electron as a swirling assembly of 12 point charges, then finding anomalous magnetic moments might be straightforward to explain with a physical model. I would expect the model would also be able to explain things, i.e., post-dict, in the observational data that are currently not explained.

Here's a 2D electron assembly pattern or architecture. The three binaries on the darker gray orbits in the center are at vastly different energy scales, radii, and it appears that observation has only been able to detect some of their characteristics.

I'm hoping these visualizations will help others see what I'm imagining in my thought experiments. These ideas are entirely based upon standard classical electromagnetism and mechanics, with point charges retrofitted with immutability. Still these are just visualizations. The simulations and math will reveal what is really going on.
