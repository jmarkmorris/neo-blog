_I wrote a few comments on this interview, which I'll include below._

@14:12 on black holes. Brian - we need to completely rethink how black holes work. If you step back a bit and ignore the structure, essentially you have swirling point charges, each implementing an immutable Planck length scale radius spherical boundary. There is NO singularity for the umpteenth time. The universe permeating spacetime is also a construct of point charges, typically very low apparent energy in the absence of concentrated matter-energy, but gaining energy and increasing in density as the radius to the center of the SMBH decreases. I mean it is simple really, this sea of spacetime aether convects standard matter constructs towards more energetic spacetime. That convection is gravity.

Point charges are conserved and essentially have a spherical immutable boundary around the Planck length. So all the point charges that enter in the SMBH pile up and the core gets denser up to the immutability limit. Are you gonna believe scientists from 100 years ago who projected backwards to a single event when they could have preserved, with no loss of scientific credibility, that it was a large number of events at different times within our observable universe? And then it wouldn't have taken long to realize that somehow those Planck cores in those SMBHs are getting ejected via some mechanism and I would place my bet on the jets as the dominant mechanism.

Then essentially what is solid core frozen (zero Kelvin, zero entropy) spacetime at maximum electromagnetic energy (packed point charges each with order Planck length radius) gets ejected as a Planck plasma and all the processes LCDM formerly assigned to the "big bang" now should be attributed to the jetting SMBH, including inflation where those point particles convert that electromagnetic potential energy from the Planck core packing to kinetic energy. And since I already told you that spacetime was made of point charges as well, that jet is going to clear any lower energy spacetime out of the way and can very well go superluminal and we can dispense with this silliness about "narrow viewing angles".

Then at any terminus that forms from a pileup of extremely energetic point charges will become the seeds of new large scale structures - such as new birthing galaxies. Note that you still get expansion throughout the universe except that it is galaxy local and depending on the history of that galaxy and that path of each photon through the galaxy, you might see more or less expansion. Imagine the photon flying through the outskirts of a galaxy and ever so slightly climbing a nearly flat spacetime energy surface and then reaching a peak geodesic and ever so slightly riding down a gentle falling spacetime energy slope as it exits the galaxy. Yet every particle of spacetime aether the photon passes is very slowly expanding if it is on the energy slope and in relative status if it is in the saddle between galaxies. There is so much new science to do. There are clear paths to explaining everything that confuses us now.

@25:00 So many wonderful scientists have tried to model the universe and most of them have some things right and other things wrong. When Juan Maldacena talks about wormholes, my guess is there is an element of truth in that the stuff that goes in an SMBH can come out via jets from the poles. So mathematically that may well look like matter-energy starting outside an SMBH, entering the SMBH, and then sometime later finding that matter-energy ejected into a universe. What everyone seems to miss is that it is the same universe and this is local to a galaxy. There is no magic. Same thing with Sir Roger's CCC. Just chop up that linear sequence and distribute those stages one per galaxy.

@37:30 On gauge symmetries, I think it is important to note that the point charges that implement the Noether core for standard matter particles have a property where the more energy they gain, the faster those point charges move and the smaller the 'radius' of the orbit. In other words, the Noether core gets smaller with energy. That sounds a lot like it might have something to do with gauge symmetry.

The easiest way to see what I am talking about is to imagine the following mechanism: An orbiting binary, positive and negative point charges chasing each other around in a circle. We have the electric force of attraction. We have the magnetic force operating in opposition. We also have the mass or inertia of the point particle. As energy is gained, the speed of the orbiting point particles wants to increase, but every increase means that the E and B fields it feels from its partner will appear to be emanating from slightly behind where the partner is 'now'. That means the E and B fields are tilting. Approaching c, the angle of tilt will have gone from 0 and asymptotically towards 90 degrees. This is I think related to the radius of the orbit shrinking.

Anyway, this is where I am currently researching to determine what I am guessing will be straightforward changes to Maxwell's equations and Coulomb's law. Something like limiting r to 2 Lp denominator (r, r>=2Lp) which keeps the term from going to zero and blowing up in a singularity, and also reflects the case that for two point charges with Lp radius immutability the closest their point charge centers can get is 2Lp. Anyway, if your kids want to solve this, or maybe Weinstein's kid, or some undergrad that is fine, go for it. I am very deliberate and the really important thing is to get this TOE done and in the hands of scientists. My work has been open source since the beginning and I welcome all collaborators.
