It has been 2.5 years since I became 100% confident in NPQG. That was in mid 2018, six months after I started this effort. I had already decoded that the universe was made from two charged particle types. My reverse engineering was not very far along at that time. As the NPQG model has improved since then, I've been surprised that it hasn't caught the attention of physicists and cosmologists yet. It seems that moment may happen soon, now that I am documenting mathematical relationships that explain the new narratives and generate discoveries such as the architecture for six of the fermions. I'm really looking forward to the breakthrough into the scientific community because then we can move on to the next phase, which is to onboard scientists and parallelize the discovery of the new era. There is an enormous amount of low hanging fruit to harvest!

Here is a picture I made in February, 2020 where I was attempting to decode the patterns of point charges I thought constituted each standard model particle.

I don't know if it is correct, but there is a lot of promise relative to the progress I am making in binary sub-assembly. Eventually we will sort this pattern out. I find it enormously exciting that stable standard matter particles may be based upon a set of nested point charge binaries at different energies and radii and orientations.

Enter the binary. It’s a 143 bit counter of Planck's constant **h** J⋅s energy quanta, variable clock, stretchy ruler, battery, accountant, a dominant emergent construct of point charges, and it permeates the universe. This is it! It has fewer point charges than any other construct. The binary diagram shows two points where GR and QM interface. There are more. QM sits on top of the one half Planck's constant **h** J⋅s pole or tipping point. Ouch! GR spacetime is implemented by r.
