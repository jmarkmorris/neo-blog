This article will cover some brainstorm level musings about collider collisions. I start with a fanciful diversion into a new term that occurred to me while writing this post.

"Nines of C" would make a great name or phrase! Hold up. Except that it's c is local in the spacetime aether. Hmm.

"**Nines of @**". Yeah. that's better. Baseball caps, T-shirts, merch?

Only if you have been following closely would you know that I have started introducing the **symbol @** to designate the universal constant speed of electromagnetic field transmission. There are important distinctions between the two, @ and c.

The speed of light c is a local phenomenon based upon characteristics of the spacetime aether. We can model local c via the concepts of permittivity and permeability. Local c is essentially the speed at which a photon traverses Euclidean time and space as a function of the apparent energy of the local spacetime aether.

The linear speed @ of the electric field expanding spherically from a point charge at time t is a universal constant speed.

Ok, a quick google search to check whether "**Nines of @**" has any unknown to me meanings, and I see my old friend "availability" appear in the top results as well as a definition of the terminology "nines."

It has occurred to me that during my career as a massively parallel system architect, I often pondered nines of availability with respect to time. This may have been an influential experiential background for my formulation of the point charge model of the universe.

What are the energy measurements of the reactants and products in a particle collider event? I once asked this in a reddit physics forum and the response was to not worry, everything balances and there is no unexplained energy. I've been wondering about that response and how to reconcile apparent and shielded energy in such a situation. Let's see if we can noodle on this and gain some insight.

- How fast are the particles moving prior to the collision?
    - CERN says 99.9999991% of c.
    
    - How many nines of c? Eight.

- What is local c for those particles?
    - The tubes are considered to be a vacuum.
        - Vacuum is not the same as empty or void or Einstein's geometry.
            - Neutrinos are flying by.
            
            - Spacetime aether permeates the tubes and reaction chamber.
    
    - In low energy aether, local c is near @, the electric field speed.

- How should we think about the apparent and shielded energies in a proton : proton collision and reaction?
    - Each proton has its rest mass derived from apparent energy
    
    - Each proton at rest had some shielded energy.
    
    - Each proton had kinetic energy accrued from applied work.
    
    - The orbital planes of the Noether cores had aligned to a degree.

- What are the dynamics with point charge structures "collide"?
    - A collision means that the structures decay into substructures.
    
    - Conservation of momentum and energy applies.
    
    - We also have conservation of immutable point charges.
    
    - It is possible to simulate the provenance of every point charge.
    
    - The decay of the protons may reveal previously shielded energy.
    
    - The Noether cores which have lost their outer binary(ies) are highly reactive with the aether and their subassembly.
    
    - Stable reaction products such as photons and neutrinos fly away.
    
    - Unstable reaction products may experience a chain of reactions and quickly be absorbed into the aether, possible with some of their energy shielded anew.
