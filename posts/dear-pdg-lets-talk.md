Very cool PBS Space Time video Jan 19, 2022 about simulations at various scales.

What could we practically simulate at the point charge level with the best available hardware and optimized simulation software?  What scales and problems would benefit from understanding the **provenance** of point charges? I am very interested in whether **provenance** of immutable point charges is helpful for advancing simulations of nature.

For those of you who know what the PDG is, by applying provenance, **_it is extremely clear that many reactions documented in the PDG are not properly accounting for inputs and outputs of very low apparent energy structures_.**  

Here are several brainstorm ideas on strategic objectives for the PDG :

- using point charge provenance identify all reactions which are missing inputs or outputs.
    - It is important that the PDG entries are technically correct.
    
    - If there are known unknowns, identify them until which time they can be understood and documented.
    
    - Ir is of critical importance for PDG to maintain its relevance.

- rethink, reframe, reimplement PDG as software as a service.
    - reference classes for object oriented point charge structures.
    
    - reaction reference based upon class structure

- reference APIs for PDG knowledge including high frequence APIs for simulation
