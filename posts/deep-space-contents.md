What are the contents of a cubic meter of deep space?

| Point Potential Assemblies | Count Per Cubic Meter | Point Potentials Per Cubic Meter | Scale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spacetime assembly clusters of pro and anti Noether cores. | 1 x 10n / m3 | ?   This is very likely an enormous number. | Varies with gravitational density, i.e., curvature of spacetime.   Calculate this from radius and assuming a packing of Noether cores.   Spacetime assemblies are not bosons.   They are tiny, high frequency, and muted due to point potential velocity.   We must also factor in the oblateness of Noether cores of spacetime as a function of proximity to dense apparent energy.   Dense layers of "pressure" cause the Noether cores to flatten. |
| Photons | 4.5 x 108 / m3 | ~1010 | Each photon is a contra-rotating pro/anti pair of Noether cores.   Locked in some kind of dance and surfing on their own emissions.   Of course, a point charge with v > @ can surf on its own emissions.   12 point potentials per photon. |
| Neutrinos | 3.3 x 108 / m3 | ~109 | Wobbly photons, not quite photons.   Neutrino Total Energy < Photon Total energy   Neutrino Apparent Energy > Photon Apparent Energy   12 point potentials per neutrino. |
| Cosmic Rays   (Protons P and atomic nuclei P+N) | 1 to 30 / m3 | ~103 | 90% hydrogen nucleii, each 1 proton. (36 point potentials)   9% helium nucleii, each 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (144 point potentials) |
| Helium Atoms | 0.089/ m3 | ~101 | Two protons, two neutrons, two electrons (168 point potentials) |
| Hydrogen Atoms | ~0.9 / m3 | ~101 | One proton, one electron. (48 point potentials) |
| Dust Grains | **1 grain per million cubic meters**      <1 / m\-6    | ~0 | **Carbon**: Often found in the form of graphite or amorphous carbon.   **Silicates**: These are compounds containing silicon and oxygen, such as olivine and pyroxene.   **Metals**: Elements like iron, nickel, and magnesium.   **Ices**: Water ice, as well as frozen gases like methane, carbon monoxide, and ammonia.   These grains are formed from the remnants of stars, such as supernovae, and can accumulate additional atoms over time, forming icy mantles. They play a crucial role in the formation of stars and planets by acting as the building blocks for larger structures in the universe. (CoPilot) |
