How Exactly is an Exchange of Energy Reciprocal?

Energy is conserved. Why is it conserved? How is that conservation implemented? It occurs to me that PE and KE only trade within each individual point potential! I think this is a breakthrough. We are not exchanging energy between point potentials are we? Because there is no bi-directional transfer mechanism. Dirac sphere potential emissions are fire and forget. Wow! What we are doing is causing a particle to change PE and/or KE. But PE is a relative measurement. PE compared to what? This is not the case for KE in the absolute frame. This now confuses the point. KE of a particle is independent of others. However, PE is always related to the 1/x scalar from each other point potential.

Is this true? Each point potential is constantly receiving one or more Dirac sphere streams from all other point potentials and possibly themselves, with the only exception being that if their velocity is less than or equal to @ there is no self action. Also the system has dynamical feedback. Furthermore, point potentials are constant rate emitters of potential.

I need to solve this for equal case and opposite case. Start with ideal line to get a feel for it.

what about this PE = -2KE stuff and the virial theorem. that probably ties to this.

this is a great way to think about things. It helps to understand what the rules and relationships are. It's also kind of confusing to think about the v > @ cases. I suppose that a shmeared-out Dirac sphere stream has less of an impact somehow. Well, you are certainly going to experience it briefly if you are passing. Aha -- however if you are in an assembly, particularly the orbiting binary, it is as if you are surfing in a constant position on the wave. How does that position vary with velocity? Fascinating way to imagine it. You can plot the magnitude I think, but the div and curl are more complicated.

* * *

This may not be related but I was reading about the virial theorem and thinking about E=mc2. So m=E/c2. If we map that to a point potential, we do have a constant flow of potential spheres. Is flowing potential the basis of all energy? I suppose that makes sense, but we have a real physical mechanism in the point potential. This makes sense because inertial mass is essentially the apparent energy of the assembly, which for a point potential is the potential flow from |q|.

What exactly is E = mc2 describing? At the point potential level how does the flux change as radius increases? circumference = 2 pi r and the ratio to r is constant. What about the sphere? A=4 pi r2. Unit potential =1q. As it spreads out is the total potential on any sphere = 1q? When r=1 A=4pi Potential at r=1 is k/r2 =k. Flux = area x potential = 4 pi r2 k / r2 = 4 pi k. Independent of radius. Potential flux is the progenitor of action.

Positive and negative potential balance, so the net potential flow in the universe is zero from the point of view of superposition. Yet that is the wrong way to think of it in reality. Because there is some average density of point potentials and they are immutable. Isn't that what truly determines the real potential flow in the universe? They are always emitting. Yes, I think that is a better way to think of it and we must therefore account for both positive potential and negative potential in separate ledgers.

Next we need to figure out what the virial theorem is really describing and then start from first principles to get back to the virial theorem. We can see right away it is talking about mass which means particle assemblies interacting with spacetime aether assemblies. This is quite distinct from the point potential perspective.

When one assembly performs work on another, the transfer of momentum comes with a corresponding change to the geometry of each assembly. There are several mechanisms from an assembly perspective.

- The translational kinetic energy of the point potentials as a function of velocity v.

- The energy stored in the binary as a function of rotational velocity, radius of the orbital, and the deformation due to path history. This is a complex blend of kinetic energy and electromagnetic potential energy.

Subject to Ponder : the point potentials in the binary with translational velocity v experience a backwards force from the angle of the history potential of their partner. What does that mean? Why is that not a constant drain on momentum? Where is the opposite effect stored? I don't see it in a single binary with v < @. With multiple binaries there is repulsive action as well to take into account.

At foundational levels we need only know the paths of the point potentials to determine the transfer of energy between them. When considering the dynamical geometry of the assembly we can learn how their mechanics operate at the lowest known level.

How many possible stable orbital solutions are there for a single binary with a given energy? I've been assuming one solution where frequency, orbital radius, and total energy are all related. This appears to me to be the best mapping to existing science.

What are we doing when we perform work on a particle at rest and give it velocity and momentum? It is gaining energy and it is a complicated mechanism with KE, PE, and orbital rotation and potential field histories.

Binary radius will change according to Planck's Law modified to yield r. We can presume the Gen III binary remains small and high energy. Therefore the Gen II radius will be larger than Gen III.

Is this related to MOND? Fermionic matter, is based upon Noether cores with greater energy which attract personality layers at a much larger radius. Thus standard matter has a much greater volumetric displacement than does spacetime aether. As we move out from the center of a galaxy, the standard matter particle density decreases and takes a precipitous drop beyond the outskirts of the galaxy. Are there observations of of standard matter density as a function of radial distance from the SMBH? Interesting thought. Exactly how far into a fermion or other assembly can spacetime aether penetrate? Do Noether cores exclude one another? I would think so.

Imagine the shape of the electromagnetic fields emitting from each binary in a Noether core. In general, the emitted fields will be alternating back and forth sinusoidally as each point potential sweeps through on its orbit. The regions near the axis of each binary are going to experience intense churn, but is there also a dynamic of stability where the personality potentials swirl around each axis? Does it make sense to imagine six axial foci for the personality layer and how those change with velocity as the binary orbital planes realign? Are these foci points the duals of Lagrange points for gravity? If this makes any sense, then how does the potential composition of the six point potentials in the personality layer play into the dynamic? Simulation appears to be the best path forward.

What are the implications of the unit potential coming in positive and negative flavors?

A problem with the "retarded" i.e., history potential diagrams is that a point potential can be influenced by one, OR MORE, locations in the history of themselves or other point potentials.

In quantum theory they have the concept of extended charges and they apply a multiplier. This was a mistake.

Don't use infinities or zero. Action is always on the 1/r sphere.

Make powerpoint picture of the case where opposite potentials start at a very large r and attract each other on a line. This is like Xeno's paradox in a way, but the potentials should just pass through and go the other way. Overall this is like a spring in the case of opposite potentials.

It is odd to think about how much action could result from multiple impinging potentials from the self or a partner.

It's especially odd when you think in terms of energy.

Is energy actually conserved?

These Dirac sphere potentials are not the same as potential energy of position.

No one is accounting for whether those Dirac sphere potentials cause an action or not, or at what r they cause action throughout the universe. Or how many times they cause action.

Action is the sum over all impinging Dirac spheres which originated from all point potentials in the universe (like Mach's principle but with point potentials instead of mass).

> _The electric potential energy of a system of point charges is defined as the work required to assemble this system of charges by bringing them close together, as in the system from an infinite distance._ _Alternatively, the electric potential energy of any given charge or system of charges is termed as the total work done by an external agent in bringing the charge or the system of charges from infinity to the present configuration **without** undergoing any acceleration._
> 
> Wikipedia

Ok, perhaps this definition of electric potential energy can be useful. It would definitely take work to cause a point potential to reach v > @. Yet work is only done by action that occurs on a Dirac sphere emitted from a point potential (including the self, and including the possibility of multiple causal contacts).

What does it mean to say "without undergoing any acceleration"? Arghh. F = ma. Wikipedia says "_the motion across the field is supposed to proceed with negligible acceleration, so as to avoid the test potential acquiring kinetic energy or producing radiation._" Ok, so the radiation part is sort of sleight of hand to avoid known effects from higher order assemblies, like the aether. In reality, we would have to accelerate the potential to move it, and then (de)accelerate it again at the destination to bring it to rest again.

Does a potential care who cashes the checks?

I don't think so. It's been emitted. It's gone. There is no accounting.

The Dirac sphere stream is immutable. Nothing changes it.

So really the question is then on action.

How does velocity relate to action.

A point potential is always traversing at velocity v the history of every partner's Dirac sphere stream at velocity v'. Including itself where the Dirac sphere may be 0 if v < @.

What does it mean to explore this history and for action to be a result?

Actions as a result of the intersecting point potentials do not change the ongoing Dirac spheres.

The potential is a mathematical object.

Does v > @ generate more local KE?

How do PE and KE stay in balance in this kind of transaction?

How does conservation work when v > @ can generate multiples of action?

On the one hand, the potential emits continuously in absolute time, regardless of the velocity of the potential. You don't get more Dirac spheres, but you do get gradients in the Dirac sphere stream.

Is it like a deferred transaction? That is a wild idea. Not sure if it makes any sense at all.

think about the velocity of the emitter changing the slope of the potential at the receiver point of action. its as if the velocity is a factor in the slope. it gets hard to think about when the emitter v > @.

Broadening the question to all stable geometries, how do we calculate the general shape of the Noether core as a function of assembly velocity? Somewhere around here we may also encounter the equations of special relativity. This sort of makes sense, because when we do work on a particle we change its velocity via acceleration. This is different than temperature, which I have come to believe is more associated with personality potentials, although I do think personality potentials are conduits to the Noether cores. It's a simple mechanism, but the emergent complexity is kind of intense at this point. Of course in the future we will have simulations that visualize all of this in slow motion and it will become how we understand nature.

* * *

Is it possible that energy and velocity are related for a binary? The higher the energy the binary radius shrinks towards the symmetry breaking point v = @.

See the formulas I was noodling the other day relative to special relativity. I was coming to this same idea, that they might be related. We have the orbital speed and the translational speed. The velocity vector is spinning like a corksrew. You also have the orbital plane behaviour, which is turning towards orthogonal to the line of travel as translational speed increases.

If so, then what happens at the symmetry breaking point? Is that the event horizon of a black hole? So the event horizon is photons or binaries actually traveling at field speed? And then symmetry breaks and they go inside towards the maximum density at @pi/2. And do we presume any apparent mass vanishes at that symmetry breaking point?

How does this help explain the Planck's law curve?

Does this intersect with Noether cores and gen II and III binary speeds?

How does SR work from the perspective of the absolute frame?

system one has velocity v1

system two has velocity v2

it's not just a v2-v1 situation.

Is special relativity wrong?

Does special relativity work at high constant velocities?

the photon is emanating from a local environment v1 energized by mass and momentum, i.e., moving energy, moving unit potentials.

the photon has to climb out of that little gravity well, which causes redshift.

and the photon traverses lower apparent energy spacetime aether

before it dives down the observer's gravity well which is blueshift.

or energy well. Basically super high potential wells.

It seems like a totally different way to consider special relativity, but it also seems more reasonable to me.

Why is this reasonable?

Because it matters.

We must understand the variable speed of light, c, in absolute velocity.

The absolute time it takes from A to B depends on absolute velocity.

We can't even presume a straight line path.

This is an essential element of special relativity, isn't it?

Even at these distances, there are geodesics.

Do the redshift and blueshift represent time in some way?

Show and review several proofs of special relativity.

Then I need to introduce the point potential geometry implementation of SR.

One of the cool things about point potentials and binaries and Noether cores is that there is so much symmetry! That explains why symmetry is so important in physics. You can also see why that symmetry leads to a plethora of theoretical and mathematical approaches to solve swaths or regions of the behaviour that emerges as point potential assemblies form and turn into standard model assemblies, and then periodic table of the elements assemblies, and then DNA protein assemblies.

The architecture of nature is beautiful and parsimonious. When you think about these Noether cores from a geometrical point of view and how the orbital planes tilt towards alignment with increasing velocity. What does that sound like? Lorentz invariance? Matrices and eigenvectors?

Since everything is Noether core based including the spacetime aether this explains why Lorentz invariance is so important to our understanding of the universe.

Here's a clip for ideation from the proper time wikipedia page. These formulas, using @ instead of c appear to be quite descriptive of some aspects of a point potential. Do they apply to a binary specifically or simply by inheritance?

Then what does it mean to say a Noether core is Lorentz invariant? Then how exactly does the Noether core implement Lorentz invariance? Is it a characteristic of the binary as well as in the radius matches this formula?

Then there is also the angle of whether special relativity is somehow influenced more by the photon than is understood. I need to dissect the way SR is defined and then approach it from the foundation.

I need to show how things work in the Euclidean frame. I also need to show how that maps to Noether core based structures. The orbital binary formula is opposite point potentials orbiting in a circle with a set of related parameters including energy, radius, point potential speed. Then we have two angles to describe the orientation of the binary. I suppose we need to know which direction it is orbiting. Then we have three binaries described thus. Then there is the overall group velocity. Then there are the personality potentials and how they influence orbital angles and mass. It is all inter-related. I should break it down step by step.

Length contraction is clearly due to the planes becoming more aligned as velocity increases. If we imagine the surface of the outer precessing orbit as it flattens. Yeah that makes total sense. So that formula is a clue on the orientation.

* * *

Let's try to map potential energy, kinetic energy, and the virial theorem to point potential systems, whether orbiting, or artificial linear systems (i.e., two point potentials close together or far apart starting with zero velocity). I'm sort of thinking that there should be a positive potential energy that forces two like particles apart, and a negative potential energy that forces two opposite particles together. I don't know if it is common to think in terms of positive and negative potential energy.

Before we dive into point potential systems, let's start with the orbiting gravitational potential system.

#### The Dirac Sea

> _The Dirac sea is a theoretical model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy. It was first postulated by the British physicist Paul Dirac in 1930 to explain the anomalous negative-energy quantum states predicted by the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons (electrons traveling near the speed of light). The positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron, was originally conceived of as a hole in the Dirac sea, before its experimental discovery in 1932._

#### Potential Energy

https://youtu.be/LYnoV2n5ptg

**What video says:**

PE = -2KE (virial theorem)

TE = KE + PE = KE + -2KE = -KE

TE = -KE

TE = -PE/2 + PE = PE/2

Total energy is negative. 

TE + delta = -KE + delta, which means that KE drops.

Negative heat capacity

- We need to factor in that the spacetime æther has absorbed E = mc2 energy from matter. That is only a potential energy though, as it exchanges with the matter as it passes. But it is always outstanding with the spacetime æther. 

- Since the system is in equilibrium, adding energy implies taking it from the spacetime æther. This means that KE must decrease, i.e., velocity must drop. Note that the reason PE = -2KE is that kinetic energy is mirrored in the spacetime æther.

KE = 0.5 mv2

PE = -2KE = -mv2

TE = 0.5mv2 – mv2 = -0.5mv2

- Matter-energy experiences pressure from higher total energy spacetime æther, and energy wants to spread out to lower energy spacetime æther,

F = GmM/r2

spacetime æther Energy += (Gravitational potential energy = mc2)

Now let's turn our attention to a point potential system which is the actual implementation of nature. How does the polarity of potential influence our understanding of the virial theorem?

It would be interesting to calculate the kinetic and potential energy of the Planck scale binary. How would that relate to the Planck energy? By pulling on this chain of inference can we understand nature? We know how close the two point potentials are, and that leads to Potential Energy. Then we have the two point potentials whirling around and we know their potential q = |e/6| and we know their speed and that is the Kinetic Energy. This is a puzzle fitting exercise where we must map between the point potential universe and known equations and concepts.

Let's see what we can learn by exploring the virial theorem.

- The positive and negative unit potential binary system matches the exact specification.

- It is a system of two (n = 2) discrete point potentials bound by potential forces.

- Potential energy V(r) = krn is the general form.

- Potential energy V(r) = kq2/r for a point potential pair, so n = -1

- 2 KE = (-1) PE = -PE

- Can we express this in terms of the potentials themselves?

- 2 (2 KEq) = - (PEq)

- And that simplifies to 4 KEq = - PEq

- Does that make sense?

- How do we calculate kinetic energy for each point potential?
    - We know the maximum velocity v ~= c pi @ / 2.
    
    - Usually we say KE = mv2/2, but we have a point potential.
    
    - How do we define mass in this case? There is no shielding.

I should also consider several other two particle systems.

- Two like point potentials on the 1/r potential curve.
    - What is the starting radius?
        - Is the limit for the radius of like point potentials the same as for opposite point potentials?
    
    - So then if the experiment starts there with v=0 then potential energy is converted to kinetic energy right?
    
    - Can we start at any radius and get the same answer for how PE and KE interchange?

- Two opposite point potentials on the 1/r potential curve
    - Start with v=0 at a very large r?
        - So KE = 0 and PE = kq(-q)/r which approaches 0 for large r.
        
        - That's interesting. So do we need to track both positive PE and negative PE? Or are they on the same spectrum?
        
        - In any case, the |magnitude| of both PE and KE would grow as r approaches 0.

This needs more thinking. Use common sense. Remember we are mapping to the virial theorem but there may be a more basic truth.

I am still kind of not completely getting the idea that unit potentials simply give us a way to perform work and capture energy. Yet the unit potentials themselves are like a continuous fountain of potential. So it gives me pause on the ideas that energy is conserved in the region where point potential velocity exceeds @.

> _In physics, the energy-momentum relation is the relativistic equation relating any object's rest (intrinsic) mass, total energy, and momentum_
> 
> Wikipedia

In NPQG we understand nature's equations from the two simultaneous perspectives of a Euclidean absolute space and linear time (Map 1) as well as a Riemannian spacetime implemented by an emergent universe permeating _æther_ (Map 2). Historically, Map 1 corresponds to Newtonian mechanics, while Map 2 corresponds to Einstein et al. Science erred when it replaced Map 1 with Map 2. The trick is that both Map 1 and Map 2 apply and we can understand nature by expressing our equations from both perspectives.

In Map 1 (Euclidean) the speed of light (i.e., photons) through spacetime æther is determined by the the local interactions with the spacetime æther as the light travels. We can express that abstractly with the concepts of permittivity and permeability. To be sure, there is an even more fundamental way to think about photons traveling through the aether.

$latex \\mathbf{c^{2}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\mu }} &s=2$

The local permittivity and permeability are determined by the density of electromagnetic energy in the neighborhood of each point in the spacetime æther. The higher the energy density, the slower the translational speed of the photon in an absolute frame. Note that when we say _**local density of energy,**_ this includes the attenuated contribution from all participating sources in the universe that arrive at a given moment.

In this post I will discuss the energy-momentum relation and how it "relates" to NPQG. Here is the equation definition from the perspective of Riemannian spacetime in Map 2.

> In physics, the energy–momentum relation is the relativistic equation relating any object's rest (intrinsic) mass, total energy, and momentum:

> $latex \\mathbf{E^{2}=(pc)^{2}+\\left(m\_{0}c^{2}\\right)^{2}} &s=2$

> 
> Wikipedia

Examine this equation and transform it to the perspective of Euclidean Map 1 space and time.

Momentum p is given by relativistic mass times velocity.

$latex \\mathbf{p=m\_{0}v\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}} &s=2$

Let's rewrite the energy-momentum relation.

$latex \\mathbf {E^{2} = \\left( m\_{0}vc \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac {1}{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\right)+\\left(m\_{0}c^{2}\\right)^{2}} &s=2$

Let's consider the intrinsic energy of a particle.

$latex \\mathbf{E\_{0}=m\_{0}c^{2}} &s=2$

Let's rewrite the energy-momentum relation in terms of intrinsic energy.

$latex \\mathbf{E^{2} = \\left({m\_{0}}c^{2}\\right)^{2} \\left( \\frac{ \\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}} }{{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\right)+\\left(m\_{0}c^{2}\\right)^{2}} &s=2$

or

$latex \\mathbf{E=E\_{0} \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}} &s=2$

For the velocity of a particle to approach the local speed of light, the local energy density is so high that the Map 1 absolute velocity of a photon is approaching zero.

Now let's apply our conversion to local permittivity and permeability.

$latex \\mathbf{c^{2}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\mu }} &s=2$

So, let's rewrite the energy-momentum equation with our new physical understanding.

$latex \\mathbf {E=E\_{0} \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{{1-v^{2} \\epsilon \\mu}}}} &s=2$

This is the fundamental formula in Euclidean space and time (Map 1) that relates rest energy of a composite particle to velocity and local energy density.

* * *

At the Planck scale, as found in a Planck core of Planck spheres, the permeability and permittivity are not infinite. Therefore we need to add two new Planck constants, $latex \\mathbf{\\epsilon\_{P}} &s=2$ and $latex \\mathbf{\\mu\_{P}} &s=2$. As we evaluate the true constants of nature we may find ways to express these in terms of other constants.

We still need to discuss more about the Planck constant of angular momentum. We need to understand the physical basis of potential energy. We need to understand how kinetic energy and potential energy relate as a function of spacetime æther energy.

* * *

If the speed of the photon c is truly vsl in the absolute sense, then that means the ability of point potentials to sail on their own field diminishes with the intensity of the potential field in terms of permittivity and permeability.

For a photon traveling through increased gravitational field the translational speed of a photon decreases, while the blueshift causes the orbital speeds to increase.

The explanation that this is only an effect for a photon-like sail mechanism seems more parsimonious, as it leaves open the possibility that the Planck scale corresponds to the highest energy binary with a superluminal speed of @pi/2 and frequency Fp,

* * *

Momentum relates to kinetic energy. It is as if kinetic energy has vector components. We know momentum does. If a fermion is being accelerated, it appears that the binaries in the Noether core structure are transferring energy between themselves to conserve momentum. If the binaries cannot maintain momentum without a reaction, they would be required to shed energy to preserve momentum.

**GAUGE GROUPS**

> _Is there a theory which explains why the gauge groups of the standard model are as they are._
> 
> Wikipedia

The Lorentz mechanism of all composite electrino/positrino particles, includine æther particles, enables an enormous variation in scale, i.e., gauge. In particular the gauge scalability of æther particles as a function of energy, is a root cause of many properties in the standard model, in particular mass, i.e., apparent energy. On top of that structures can capture structures and shield their energy. Thus some reactions might appear to jump to an entirely different energy level if they crack open the structures. Without an understanding of the physical implementation, gauge groups and renormalizations helped physicists work with these behaviours in their theories.

Nature has the ability to seamlessly transition through many orders of magnitude of scale. To understand nature you need to think in terms of the **_Lorentz_** factor, and think logarithmically. What **_intelligent individuals_** perceive or define as 0 or 1 may sometimes be nature at 0.000...001 or 0.999...999. The Lorentz factor helps us understand the relationship of photon speed and energy as observed from 4D Euclidean space and time.

Let's consider the equivalence principle and the implementation of Lorentz invariance. Is it entirely determined by the moving assembly sans the aether sea? Or is it a relationship **between** the moving assembly and the aether assemblies?

> 
> Wikipedia

This seems to indicate that the implementation that leads to the same effect in these two situations must be a relationship between the aether assemblies and the particle assemblies for the clock and the real observer (versus the **virtual** absolute observer). Why? Let's break it down.

We also need to determine what is the dynamical geometry that implements a "clock." Is it the frequency of the binaries? Is orbital plane orientation a factor?

**Case 1: Special relativistic "kinetic" time dilation**. aka : **Moving clock**

- In absolute relativity, there really is one clock that is moving and one that is not.

- The particle assemblies that are moving, have had work performed on them, and have stored the energy in both binary radii reduction and orbital plane rotation. They are in a stressed geometry.

- The spacetime aether assemblies can also be imagined at zero absolute group velocity in the thought experiment. These assemblies are in an unstressed geometry of zero velocity and zero energy gradient.

- We need to precisely define stress, but at this point we can assume it is one or both divergences from the unstressed state, i.e., binary radii and plane.

- Each photon emitted by the moving clock must also do so from stressed (higher energy) assemblies. Does that have any effect?

**Case 2: General relativistic gravitational time dilation**. aka : **Clock nearer to a massive body**

- The clock is considered to have zero absolute velocity, so its assemblies are unstressed.

- The spacetime aether assemblies experience stress due to the energy gradient from the massive body.

- This raises the question of whether the aether local to the clock is at zero/low velocity or is something more exotic happening, like the massive body passing through aether that all starts rushing towards the center of the body? The exotic scenario has issues.

- Are the photons emitted from the clock impacted by the gravitational field?

If Case 1 and 2 are equivalent, then it must be the case that it doesn't really matter which of the assemblies are stressed, i.e., the clock or the aether.

> _The stress–energy tensor, sometimes called the stress–energy–momentum tensor or the energy–momentum tensor, is a tensor physical quantity that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime, generalizing the stress tensor of Newtonian physics. It is an attribute of matter, radiation, and non-gravitational force fields. This density and flux of energy and momentum are the sources of the gravitational field in the Einstein field equations of general relativity, just as mass density is the source of such a field in Newtonian gravity._
> 
> Wikipedia

It sure seems like this idea of stressed matter and aether assemblies could be a fit with Einstein's formulation.

What can we deduce about the geometry of nature from the Lorentz transformations. There are three important assemblies.

1. The fermions themselves that make up atoms, etc.

3. The spacetime aether through which the fermions are passing.

5. The photons which are emitted and observed.

The dynamical geometry of point potentials and assemblies presents quite a challenge to understand what is really happening in nature and how to map the math between systems. There are several complex interactions happening in this scenario including the path of the emitted photon which must climb out of a local gravity well.

N.B. The Lorentz transformation only applies between inertial, i.e., non-accelerating, frames. This is true for the group velocities of the point potentials comprising the observer and observed in the two frames. However, every assembly has a core of nested orbiting binaries, and those point potentials experience very high acceleration in their orbits. This is a fine point, but nevertheless, interesting.
