Our entire universe is composed of a Euclidean void of time and space populated with a large-scale density of energy generating and carrying point potentials. What are the emergent processes that lead to assembly and disassembly of standard model "particles"?

The high energy endpoints of the universe, Planck cores of point potentials, are where emergence commences. Planck cores are primarily found in some supermassive black holes, and perhaps in black holes, or high energy orbs or events. How did the point potentials in Planck cores accumulate? It is all a matter of the inexorable "gravitational" tug towards dense high energy objects. The standard model assemblies inbound to a Planck core first deflate and then decay as they progress to higher and higher energy. At some point the density is reached where individual binaries dominate in a plasma. As the kinetic energy of binary point potentials increases, their binary orbital radius drops towards a geometrical minimum, corresponding to a maximum orbital curvature, based upon point potential physics.

As binaries continue inward toward the Planck core they may decay in a reaction with other binaries. Eventually the plasma is of such high energy that the relative movement of point potentials is quenched. This is the ultimate energy Planck core which may "freeze" in relative position, with one group microstate, meaning the Planck core has zero entropy.

It may seem odd to consider that the only "**material**" components of the universe, the positive and negative point potentials, can freeze in position at the very highest energy configuration. However, it makes total sense, given the physics of point potentials, and it solves some major problems in theory of nature.

Now we have established how Planck cores form. Let's employ our virtual absolute observer to explore the emergence of the triply nested binaries we call Noether cores as point charges travel away from the Planck core towards lower energy density.

- Near the Planck core the observer sees the emergence of semi-stable binary assemblies.

- As the binaries dissipate energy to lesser energy neighbors as they travel away from the core, they inflate, i.e., they experience rapid increase in orbital radius.

- Binary capture leads to the formation of doubly nested binaries, and then **triply** nested binaries which stabilize in our **three dimensional** Euclidean space.

- A triply nested binary is termed a **Noether core**.
    - Due to superposition, Noether cores are **stealthy**.
    
    - Noether cores are stable, and they scale from low to high energy,
    
    - Noether cores are reusable and are found in all standard model "particles".
    
    - Noether cores change shape with velocity and with gravitational gradient.

- Inflation continues as the orbital radii of the binaries in the Noether core increase.

- Pro and anti Noether cores of spacetime may emit through the event horizon or via jets.

- Recall that the event horizon is calculated based on photons, which are assemblies.
    - _**N.B.** The photon geometry leverages the Noether cores of spacetime._

- Our observer notes many ephemeral fragments of assemblies with short lifetimes.

- At various thresholds stable particles of the standard model form and become stable.
    - i.e., personality charges couple to Noether cores, creating pro and anti fermions.

- This is essentially the process described in the narrative of the inflationary Big Bang, except that it occurs mainly with respect to supermassive black holes found in galaxies.

Now let's review other characteristics of Noether cores.

- Low group velocity Noether cores of deep space have nearly perfect circular binary orbits.

- Noether core geometry changes from spherical to oblate to flat as group velocity increases. This is due to the potential emission delay effects from path history.
    - This behaviour is the basis for the equivalence principle.

- Reactions may repurpose Noether cores of spacetime to produce photons and neutrinos.
    - These assemblies have a flat geometry due to their speed being near field speed.
    
    - Contra-rotating, pro and anti Noether cores form a photon.
    
    - Neutrinos may be a configuration that didn't achieve the energy to become cloaked in the photon assembly moving at a velocity very close to field speed.
        - Neutrino assemblies are wobbly and have cyclic superposition.

- Everything in the universe is based on an architecture from which emerge assemblies.

- The most stable assemblies in low energy environments, by volume and population are ones built upon a triply nested Noether core:
    - Noether cores of spacetime (cloaked by superposition)
    
    - Standard model particle assemblies based on Noether cores.
    
    - Intermediate or fragmentary assemblies (W and Z bosons, assembly fragments)

- The Noether core maps directly to both General Relativity and Quantum Theory.

Planck cores contain an immensely huge reservoir of high energy point potentials. As they emerge as Noether cores, cloaked by superposition, they inflate and expand, and along the way take on a role, mostly as spacetime aether assemblies, but also as the other standard model particles. Higher energy Noether cores tend to shed energy to lower energy Noether cores. Some Noether cores couple with assembly fragments in high energy events and reactions, thus creating the fermions, which reveal more of the shielded energy, and thus are subject to gravitation.

In this post we have discussed where Noether cores form and how their emergence leads to the universe we observe. The massy assemblies in the universe then trend back towards even more massive objects, ultimately towards the supermassive black hole found in each galaxy. Thus the universe is essentially a system of cycles of cycles.
