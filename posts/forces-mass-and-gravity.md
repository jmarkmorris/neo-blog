Here is a conceptual diagram to illustrate the four forces of nature. This figure indicates one imagination of a standard model particle assembly as a Noether core with personality charges. The core is considered to be the nucleus while the personality charges are positioned in the polar regions.

The strong interaction is the interaction force or coupling between Noether core binaries in separate sub-assemblies. In the case of the nucleon this coupling is called a gluon.

- The gravitational interaction is a Noether core to Noether core flow of energy via an alternating potential RMS mechanism.

- The electromagnetic interaction is generally between personality charges at the scale of electrons and protons. At the fundamental level, everything is based upon point potentials.

- The weak interaction occurs when an assembly is undergoing a reaction and the configuration of the Noether core and personality charges are changing. W and Z bosons might be considered to be ephemeral assemblies.

Let's talk about gravitational force because that seems to be the least well understood physically. Einstein described gravitation with beautiful mathematics in general relativity, but the implementation he described is incomplete. Einstein attributed gravitation and acceleration in general as the warping of spacetime around mass. Besides being terribly non-intuitive with respect to warping of spacetime, there is a second issue in that mass is not well understood—there is no general theory of mass.

In **NPQG** we understand mass to be related to the excitement or coupling to nearby spacetime. We also understand spacetime to be implemented with a universe permeating æther of clusters of pro and anti Noether cores. Spacetime æther assemblies have very low apparent energy in free space and the black body radiation spectrum of spacetime æther is 2.7 Kelvin, and the fact that is the same as the "CMB" is no coincidence. The cores of neighboring particles impart an ebb and flow of energy on each other, with the high energy shells of fermionic matter particles dominating the energy dynamic in low energy spacetime æther.

Spacetime æther provides the mechanisms to implement gravity and Einstein's curvy spacetime. Specifically, the energy of spacetime æther and the gradient of spacetime æther energy are the mechanisms that implement gravity via convection. Furthermore, spacetime æther particles shrink as they gain energy, thereby implementing deflation. As spacetime æther gains energy, the electrinos and positrinos in the spacetime æther cores move faster and this is the implementation mechanism for time dilation.

Dr. Kirsten Hacker, a physicist with two decades of experience, often writes about physics in an intuitive descriptive language in which I find similarities to concepts in NPQG. I find this exciting because Kirsten is reducing from mathematical language to intuitive descriptions, while I am working from a neoclassical foundation and attempting to reverse engineer nature and the universe intuitively and deductively. So when we both arrive at similar concepts, that is a very promising indicator that NPQG is directionally aligned with the mathematics of physics!

I'll quote Kirsten's blog post and video "[An Exclusion Principle](https://wordpress.com/read/blogs/160704058/posts/4281)" as well as some of her Quora posts and comment about how they relate to NPQG. In these posts Kirsten is discussing mass and gravity.

> _"To solve the mass gap problem in the language of fields, a few heuristics must first be introduced. Per the original interpretation of the [Laplacian](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-intuition-behind-a-Laplacian-matrix-Im-not-so-much-interested-in-mathematical-details-or-technical-applications-Im-trying-to-grasp-what-a-laplacian-matrix-actually-represents-and-what-aspects-of-a-graph-it-makes-accessible/answer/Kirsten-Hacker), the gravitational field is caused by a linear, **breathing motion** of an object which is proportional to the energy or mass contained within the object. Per the equipartition theorem, this energy is made up of equal parts rotation and linear motion. An electromagnetic field is caused by rotational and linear motions that are perpendicular to and out of synch with the fluctuating pressure or breathing motion driving gravity. Because they are out of synch, gravitational and electromagnetic fields are constantly exchanging energy."_

I nearly bolted out of my chair when I saw Kirsten use the term "breathing motion," because this is exactly what I have intuited in terms of the ebb and flow of energy between particle shells. I imagine that the breathing motion or ebb-and-flow is the result of the electrinos and positrinos in nearby shells coming into proximity as they fly their wave equation orbits. Thus electrinos would be attracted to positrinos electromagnetically and this would very slightly accelerate them upon approach, increasing their kinetic energy, and decelerate them after passing, decreasing their kinetic energy. Likewise as a positrino passes near to a positrino in another shell (or electrino passes electrino), the electromagnetic force of repulsion would slightly decelerate them as they approach and accelerate them after they pass. These motions would also produce a small wobble in the orbits of these particles depending on the push-me pull-you effect as Dr. Doolittle would say. This all ties together with the shells being the main component of mass.

> _"The Laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a function on Euclidean space. That sounds a bit abstract, but “the divergence of the gradient” could also be written as “the change of a rate of change”, as in, you are swinging back and forth on a swing and someone pushes or pulls on you."_

The concept of the Laplacian is a direct fit with NPQG. The electrinos and positrinos in a shell are under constant acceleration as they travel the particle orbit. The magnitude of that acceleration is fairly constant but the direction is changing continuously, always pointing near the center. Now, add in the interaction with adjacent particle shells and you have the "change of the change" or the "divergence of the gradient". Kirsten also calls this "jiggle." Fantastic!

The concept of mass is not fundamentally intrinsic. Shell energy plays an important role in stability of the particle. At very low shell energies, it can not maintain containment and the particle decays. This corresponds to a low particle half-life. As shell energy increases, the stability duration elongates and the half life increases. Beyond that, if the shell energy increases further then at some point the particle might become radioactive and interact with spacetime æther to create high energy photons. Another important factor is the energy of the surrounding spacetime æther and the gradient or slope of that energy. In all of these cases, each shell is interacting with neighboring particles which are dominated by spacetime æther. That interaction involves changes in an alternating energy flux between particles. This flux factors into the mass of each particle.

- Personality charges : composition, charge, energy

- Noether core : composition, energy

- Spacetime æther : energy, and the gradient of energy.

- Velocity

- Acceleration

Once the formula or relationship for all of the mass factors is understood, we will be able to substitute in the revised equation in all places where mass is used. This will provide a physical explanation for the emergence of mass.
