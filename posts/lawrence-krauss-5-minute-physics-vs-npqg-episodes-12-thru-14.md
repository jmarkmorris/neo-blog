Dr. Lawrence Krauss posted a fascinating series of "5 Minute Physics" videos circa April/May 2020. They are filmed in and around his Oregon home, which is in a lovely woods with a creek running through it, and this yields a very pleasing viewing experience. In this post I'll review Dr. Krauss's videos and compare and contrast **NPQG**.

**Episode 12** : Dr. Krauss defines fundamental dimensions of length, time, and mass. For some unexplained reason he dismisses charge. This is somewhat amusing from an NPQG perspective because we know that mass is an emergent dimension that arises from the electromagnetic interaction of emergent standard matter-energy with emergent spacetime æther. Dr Krauss goes on to discuss how the speed of light is the same for all observers thus he can use c to express length in units of time. Again this is amusing, because he is discussing units of length and time in the spacetime æther, yet we know that NPQG teaches that in fundamental Euclidean space the speed of light varies and length contracts and time dilates.

**Episode 13** : This episode is about virtual particles. In NPQG virtual particles are explained and they are not virtual. Since spacetime is an æther of particles most of which are at low energy, these particles are highly reactive. It doesn't take much for the æther particles to react and make standard matter particles, also at low energy. Occasionally there is an event where standard matter particles are produced that are stable. Since the æther is composed of neutral particles and due to conservation laws, anytime a particle is created the opposite particle must also be created. QM calls those opposite particles anti-matter. NPQG can not yet explain why the matter particles appear to be stable while the anti-matter particles seem to be absorbed back into the æther.

I won't address the 'backwards in time' nonsense is this video, because GR-QM era physicists don't understand the root cause of time, which is the orbital speed of particle shells, dominated by the particles of the spacetime æther.

**Episode 14** : In this episode Dr. Krauss discusses refraction in a medium. It is so ironic that scientists understand refraction, but then when it comes to lensing of light around a massive object such as a black hole, they attribute it to Einstein's curvy spacetime instead of refraction in a spacetime æther. The interesting difference when it comes to spacetime æther is that the change in permittivity and permeability that causes refraction is very gradual and continuous in almost all cases (high energy events excluded).

I hope the readers who make it through all of these videos and my responses will appreciate Dr. Krauss's series as well as see how the GR-QM-ΛCDM era will be supplanted by NPQG.
