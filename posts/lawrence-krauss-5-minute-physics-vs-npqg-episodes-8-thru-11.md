Dr. Lawrence Krauss posted a fascinating series of "5 Minute Physics" videos circa April/May 2020. They are filmed in and around his Oregon home, which is in a lovely woods with a creek running through it, and this yields a very pleasing viewing experience. In this post I'll review Dr. Krauss's videos and compare and contrast **NPQG**.

**Episode 8** : Dr. Krauss waxes philosophical about how it is very strange and perhaps miraculous that water expands when it freezes. That is odd because most other materials contract when they freeze. He means _miraculous_ in a scientific way, and it would probably be more accurate to say _serendipitous_ or _fortunate_. He then discusses why this behaviour of water may be essential to life on Earth. I found this to be interesting because spacetime æther has a similar property in that it expands as it cools and loses energy and contracts as it gains energy. This is of course the characteristic of the spacetime æther that leads to Einstein's curviness and behaviours like space contraction and time dilation.

**Episode 9** : This episode is about general relativity. Dr. Krauss starts with a discussion of kinetic energy and potential energy as they relate to position in space around a massive object. He ties in gravity and calculates escape velocity. When I think about this from the perspective of NPQG, I imagine the velocity magnitude of the point charges in each standard matter assembly as well as the velocity magnitude that matter-energy causes in nearby spacetime æther from the ebb and flow of gravitational energy. This is all fascinating and will lead to entirely new ways of understanding particle and gravitational energy in the NPQG era.

Next the discussion moves to universe expansion and the Hubble rate and it is entirely nonsense. NPQG teaches that expansion is galaxy local and in opposition. The universe is not expanding outward, it is expanding inward in a sense. Every galaxy is in a different stage of expansion. Whenever you hear scientists talking about open vs closed universe, Big Crunches, Big Bangs, and expansion outward of the universe, you can now chuckle at this grand confusion of the _Λ_CDM era. Not only is the universe based on flat Euclidean space, but the spacetime æther is in an a quasi steady state throughout the universe with only slow drifting of æther from region to region on large scales.

**Episode 10** : This is the first in a cluster of three videos about why physics is so simple. Dr. Krauss refers to the old saw of a physicist beginning a lecture with "Assume a cow is a sphere...." This is both funny and ironic. It is funny because physicists do rightly use abstraction in a very powerful way to cut through extraneous detail. It is also ironic, because as we now know, the GR-QM-_Λ_CDM era has built in some incredibly complex ideas and mathematics that are not only wrong but they obscure the physicists view of the simplicity of nature and the universe.

**Episode 11** : Dr Krauss runs through the calculations to show that the atoms in one breath of air are very likely to contain atoms that Julius Caesar exhaled in his last breath, while saying "Et tu, Brutus?" Interestingly, atoms are mutable — they may decay into constituents. However, in NPQG the electrino and positrino point charges, can never be destroyed. Thus the electrinos and positrinos that comprise our bodies are as old as the universe, which we may consider to be infinitely old. Those electrinos and positrinos may have been in our Milky Way galaxy for quite a while, as the dominant process in the universe is a galaxy local recycling cosmology. However, particles do move through and between galaxies as well, with photons being the prime example. So when you look up at the stars at night, the photons you see are composite particles made of electrinos and positrinos that have traveled from another star in the Milky Way to land here on Earth and react with your retina. Our telescopes of course see photons from all over the universe and those photons represent a significant source of the intergalaxy exchange of matter-energy.

I hope the readers who make it through all of these videos and my responses will appreciate Dr. Krauss's series as well as see how the GR-QM-ΛCDM era will be supplanted by NPQG.
