There are many previously [unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics) which are solved or will be solved using the Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity model. In this post I'll discuss where modern physics is wrong.

_WRONG:_ **Supermassive black hole jets are formed when accretion disk material is sucked up to the poles and expelled.**

The main driver of supermassive black hole jets is the surface breach of a Planck scale point charge core. The jets are composed of Planck point charge plasma which reacts and forms composite particle assemblies with energy cores made of nested point charge binaries that inflate geometrically as they transfer energy, react, and cool. Physicists will need to re-evaluate whether these powerful Planck plasma jets can also suck up accretion disk material.

_WRONG:_ **The Big Bang**

There was no one time inflationary big bang at the beginning of the universe. Didn't happen. LeMaitre erred by projecting backwards to a single event. The reality is simpler and far more logical. Throughout the universe there are intermittent inflationary mini-bangs and these each are **galaxy local**. The process described by the big bang theory is similar to what happens when Planck plasma erupts from an SMBH. Planck plasma can erupt from a supermassive black hole core as polar jets under certain conditions. If you are familiar with images of jetting supermassive black holes, imagine that we overlay the big bang inflation timeline on both polar jets as a first approximation of the process.

_WRONG:_ **Cosmological Inflation**

Since there was no big bang, there was no one time cosmological inflation. Instead, inflation is a routine event in the universe, intermittently occurring when Planck scale point charge plasma emits from high energy objects or events. In particular, Planck scale point charge plasma jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) supermassive black holes (SMBH) are a source of inflation. Therefore, inflation/expansion of outflow may vary depending on the galactic neighborhood and the current stage of each galaxy in the recycling process. Interestingly while scientists know that the Big Bang occurred all over the cosmos, and that inflation is 'eternal' and ongoing, they do not assign a physical root cause. The AGN SMBH is the quite obvious candidate.

_WRONG:_ **Singularity**

Einstein's general relativity predicts a singularity where general relativity breaks down. This has captured the imagination of the public and befuddled the thinking of physicists. In reality, the "singularity" is a phase change where extremely dense and energetic electrinos and positrinos reach maximum energy and merge into a Planck core of a black hole. The "singularity" is not an infinitesimally small point nor a wormhole! Instead, a sufficiently energetic black hole may develop a core volume of Planck energy immutable point charges. I imagine these particles stacked like a lattice or crystal, with each particle placed so as to store maximum energy. Think of a black hole core as the ultimate battery. General relativity does not apply to Planck particles and we know that because the general relativity mathematics does not describe the singularity properly. Physically, the implementation of the singularity as a Planck core means a volume of immutable point charges at maximum energy, which can neither receive nor transmit gravitational energy. When conditions are sufficient, a Planck core may penetrate the surface of the black hole as a polar jet, or breach as a bang (not the big bang, but a galaxy-local bang).

_WRONG:_ **Einstein's Curvy Spacetime**

The background or vessel for our universe is Euclidean (flat) time and 3D space. Nothing special. A void. Permeating this void are spacetime æther particles, which are point charge assemblies made from electrinos and positrinos, the two fundamental particles of nature. It is this spacetime æther which mechanically implements curvy Riemannian spacetime of Einstein. The spacetime æther exchanges energy with standard matter and this is the cause of matter-energy mass. Energy pulses in a give and take between particle assemblies and the aether of Higgs assembly clusters. This is what propagates a gravitational wave through the spacetime æther. The gradient of spacetime æther energy causes convection of standard matter, i.e., the force of gravity.

_WRONG:_ **The Vacuum, the Quantum Vacuum, and Pair Production**

There has been a long confused history of science and "empty space." Let's go back to 1887 when Michelson-Morley falsified the aether. That was a **_big_** **_oops_**. All they could really say was that they ruled out an aether at the scales and characteristics they could measure, which absolutely **DOES NOT** rule out an aether! In the modern era, physicists think there is a quantum aether which can produce particle-antiparticle pairs. Well, it's a lot more than just a lucky coincidence of fluctuating quantum fields! Einstein's abstract spacetime geometry is really implemented by an æther dominated by low apparent energy point charge assemblies. Spacetime æther may be structured as a gas, foam, or lattice of particles and may be a Bose-Einstein condensate. Furthermore the spacetime æther has the property that the radius and frequency of the æther particle energy core always preserves the distance/time ratio that equals c = 3 x 108 m/s given that rulers (meters) contract and clocks (seconds) dilate in high energy spacetime.

_WRONG:_ **Show Me the Dark Matter**

Modern physics TOTALLY MISUNDERSTOOD galaxy dynamics, including rotation curves, because of a **tragedy of errors**.

- **Physicists did not understand** that spacetime is point charge assembly based and contains energy and can participate itself in gravity.

- **Physicists did not understand** matter-energy recycling in supermassive black holes.

- **Physicists did not realize** that the singularity was a phase change.

- **Physicists did not realize** that black hole jets can include point charge plasma erupting from a Planck core.

- **Physicists did not** **understand** galaxy local inflation and expansion.

- **Physicists did not** **understand** energy shielding in standard model particle assembly energy cores.

- **Physicists did not** **understand** that black holes shield energy in a Planck core.

_WRONG:_ **The Speed of Light**

The speed of light is a constant when viewed from within the spacetime aether (Map 2) but not a constant if viewed from the absolute Euclidean frame (Map 1) of space and time. In Map 1, c varies with permittivity and permeability of spacetime æther and both of those vary based on energy of the spacetime æther (specifically the vector potential). Gravitational lensing around dense matter-energy objects is refraction.

_WRONG:_ **How to Interpret Redshift**

Inflation and expansion are routine occurrences in the universe, yet scientists have not interpreted expansion properly as being galaxy local. The small community that identified anomalous redshift (Arp, Burbidge, et al) may have been on to something, but they didn't know why. Objective physicists should have detected this situation and supported investigations.

I think NPQG will lead to new insights about redshift and possibly techniques to survey, map, and measure galaxy local spacetime energy and gradient.

_CONFUSED:_ **The science interpretation of an active galactic nucleus.**

There is a lot going on in an AGN. If the SMBH is jetting, there will be intense inflation. There will be incredibly energetic Planck point charge plasma reacting as quickly as possible and releasing energy, and creating standard matter-energy products of those reactions. It is likely a maelstrom of activity and reaction chains. Intense gravity will be attracting matter back towards the galactic plane. Some of the ejecta may be destined to be pulled back into the SMBH for another loop of recycling. Certainly, all of this will have impact on galaxy dynamics. A whole new subfield of forensic galaxy history may emerge where the patterns of galaxies and their surroundings can be studied and scientists can rewind and understand galaxy history through simulation.

_WRONG:_ **Missing Antimatter (aka Baryon Asymmetry)**

The missing antimatter is hiding in plain sight. Photons include an anti-Noether core. Spacetime aether is chock full of anti-Noether cores loosely coupled with pro Noether cores. Nothing is missing in NPQG.

* * *

_WRONG:_ **Information may be lost in black holes, and is certainly not stored on the event horizon.** **The holographic universe concept is wrong.**

No information can survive the phase transition to a Planck core.

* * *

_WRONG:_ **The second law of thermodynamics should be an equality. Entropy is conserved.**

GR-QM era scientists did not model the spacetime æther and therefore did not consider the microstates of the spacetime æther.
