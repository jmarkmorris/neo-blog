Does the Higgs correspond to the assemblies of spacetime aether that are adjacent to matter constructs?

This is interesting:

> _One of the most puzzling features of the Universe is the strong nuclear force. Inside every proton or neutron-like particle, there are three quarks, each of which has their own color. All three colors combined add up to a colorless combination, which the Universe seems to mandate. You can either have three quarks, three antiquarks (with corresponding anticolors), or a quark-antiquark combination: with colors-anticolors that cancel out._

- The Noether core is three nested binaries, sometimes indicated as (3:3)

- Up = -1/5 (3:3)

- Down = -4/2 (3:3)

- Every particle for which we have decoded the point charge formulation has an even number of point charges.

We have a GitHub project setup for NPQG software, including a simulation language. Point charges are base classes from which all other constructs inherit. It makes so much sense to be object oriented. Nature is based on inheritance. All objects have dimensions for all conserved properties and components of such properties. We’ll also want NPQG as a service versioned APIs that provide known specifications. Scientific and educational software can build upon these NPQG libraries and APIs.

Example : Neither kinetic energy or electromagnetic energy is conserved, but their sum is conserved.

Points to ponder :

- In lower energy portions of the universe, standard matter is what is left standing after the maelstrom. Everything else decayed, recombined, or radiated.

- In a point particle world, one reason you see nested circular orbits is because that is a very stable configuration.

- Nature loves to repeat patterns from lower scales.
    - binaries
    
    - solar systems
    
    - galaxies

- There can be many reasons we don’t find particular constructs in an environment. One reason is that somehere along their world lines they became unstable and decayed.

- Many aspects of the nature of an assembly are due to the personality charges. The number of binaries in the core doesn’t change these characteristics. One example is charge.

- Do Noether cores have multiple stable configurations? If so they may have different behaviour. Each configuration of a Noether core would have different potential field distributions.

Terminology enhancements for energy shielding:

- Apparent energy = mass \* c^2 = gravitationally radiating energy

- Total energy = apparent energy + shielded energy

- In an electron neutrino the apparent and shielded energy oscillate between all three binaries.
