Reading Kirsten's article **[True Genius](https://kirstenhacker.wordpress.com/2019/08/16/true-genius/)** reminded me of my reaction to Walter Isaacson's writing on Albert Einstein's treatment of Mileva Marić. Einstein's treatment of Mileva Marić is infuriating. In 2018, I listened to the Audible version of Walter Isaacson's book **[Einstein](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V1A1YQ)** while walking in the park over a series of days. Isaacson lays out the facts, and my conclusion is that **Albert Einstein used and leveraged Mileva Marić in nearly every way imaginable.** I lost a huge amount of respect for Einstein upon learning of the extent of his exploitation of Mileva intellectually and personally.

Yet, I have wondered, often late at night, .... _Is there more to the story?_ I'm not big on conspiracies, but there is still the occasional question in my mind, **Did Mileva, or Mileva and Albert, discover the fundamental reality of nature, and keep it secret?** Or through collaboraton, was such a secretive course of action determined by 1927 Solvay? If so, why? If so, what is the provenance of that knowledge since that time?

Kirsten's posts also notice a pattern in the fields of physics and cosmology that are difficult to explain. Is the vast confusion and paucity of fundamental progress in these fields due to lack of imagination, incompetence, the natural artifact of power and funding struggles, or conspiracy? If you read Unzicker, you will find that Einstein had a classical particle based solution and he abandoned it. Unzicker calls this a great mistake. Later, circa 1927, De Broglie's pilot wave ideas seemed to have been abandoned. And again with Bohm and what is now called de Broglie-Bohm mechanics. There does seem to be a pattern here. There has been an immense negative pressure and paucity of funding on any classical theory. The overwhelming marketing and funding has gone into the mostly impossible to understand quantum mechanics which has been held out as the single path forward. As if quantum mechanics were a religion. Amplify all that with the bizarre notions of a Big Bang, a singularity, dark matter, and dark energy. Really? From there you can invent anything to **WOW** the funding agencies and the public. Many worlds! Wormholes! and on and on. **All pure nonsense!**
