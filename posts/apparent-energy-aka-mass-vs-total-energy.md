I think it may be eye-opening to consider **apparent energy** (_aka mass_!) vs. **total energy** for inertial (non or relatively slow moving) particles. GR/QM era physicists are not aware that generation I fermions contain the energy of the generation II and generation III fermons, albeit in a shielded form, via superposition. It's rather bizarre that physicists didn't consider nature from this perspective, but then again, physicists threw away point charges rather rashly, didn't they?

Let's start getting a feel for this situation. How does the apparent energy of an electron compare to the entire structure including any shielded and embedded substructures? Let's chart out the masses of the generations of the fermions. First of all, note that the apparent energy of an electron is so small, that it does not appear even as a sliver in this pie chart, even though its label does. _N.B. this is one of the few cases where I find pie charts both useful and tolerable._

Consider the apparent energy of the electron, muon, and tau with their nested Noether core. The muon and tau are incredibly unstable in the wild because _reasons_, mainly being that if you want to survive you need a structure that provides containment and stealth in three dimensions of space. The muon only has two containment or stability dimensions because it has two binaries. The tau electron has only only one dimension of stability/containment because it has one binary. Note that a **2D** or **1D** formulation of a particle can be perfectly hunky dory in certain situations â€” such as where one or two degrees of containment or stability are provided through another mechanism, like a very dense structure, aka black hole and perhaps its less dense precursors.

The electron family was eye-opening. Let's take a look at the quarks. The the up quark family is even more extreme than the electron family, with the charm quark apparent energy barely being a sliver of meager pie. Again, the low apparent energy, aka mass, of the up quark is so small that the sliver is not visible. The down quark family is only slightly less extreme.

We are unable to directly observe the enormous shielded energy of generation II and III fermions except in a collider or high energy event that strips off the outer shielding binary(ies) from the Noether cores that power the particles. There is no visible Generation I energy in the pie charts because Generation I energy pales in comparison to the shielded energy held in the inner binaries of Generation II and III. As you can clearly see, even Generation II possesses only a sliver of energy in comparison to Generation III.

Examine this handy chart which summarizes the apparent and total energy of the electron and quark structures as well as the proton and neutron superstructures, as well as the constituents of Deuterium which is an isotope of Hydrogen with one proton, one neutron, and one electron. Note that the apparent energy of the composite superstructures is NOT the sum of the apparent energy of their Generation I constituents. Instead, the dance of the quarks inside each nucleon, and more specifically the swift exchange of Noether core binaries acting as gluons, causes considerably more of the total energy to be revealed. It turns out that the mass of Deuterium is **1875.61** MeV/c2, which is slightly less than the sum of the apparent energy of its constituents. Presumably the superstructure shields about 3 MeV/c2 or perhaps that small bit of energy was released via photons when the Deuterium isotope was formed.

It is absolutely fascinating that the ratio of total energy to apparent energy of particles ranges from factors in the hundreds to tens of thousands. What if we could find a safe way to tap into that shielded energy? Ponder the implications. **_Nature is fun!_**
