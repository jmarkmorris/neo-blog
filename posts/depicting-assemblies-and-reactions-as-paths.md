Imagine how much fun it would be to diagram the network of processes in a **radioisotope thermoelectric generator** (RTG) using point charge theory. Visualize tracing the provenance and path of every point charge involved in the main process sequence. Trace the PE and KE as it flows.

RTG's are advanced technology by current standards. Yet, if you knew the point charge process network you would see that it is a complex Rube Goldberg machine. There is no doubt that there are processes many orders of magnitude more efficient and optimized.

Most RTGs use Plutonium-238 which has a half-life of 87.7 years. Each Pu-238 atom is made of 9696 point charges arranged in particle assemblies. Pu-238 has 94 protons, 144 neutrons, and 94 electrons. Protons are up-down-up. Neutrons are down-up-down. See the chart. Pu-238 decays.

Imagine a single binary orbiting transverse to its assembly path or it's center of charge (_interesting concept_). A blue sphere electrino and a red sphere positrino separated in phase by pi radians. Now imagine the path history of each charge shown in light blue and light red traces. It should look like a double helix with one helix blue and one helix red. Finally, imagine tracers from the point of potential emission on each charge to the point of action with the partner charge. Note how similar this structure is to the double helix of DNA. Nature (personified) loves to repeat patterns.

Keep working on visualizing the assembly. Freeze the motion, zoom to the scale of interest, play at reasonable speed, zoom out. What is moving fast? What is moving slow? Repeat until it becomes natural. Add features. Precession. Personality charges. Assembly velocity. Repeat.

It's a challenge at first, but then it becomes natural to imagine. We'll get a much better visceral feel for assemblies and the their point charge path histories when simulations with visualization are available.

Can you visualize the motion of the ten thousand point charges that make a single atom of Pu-238? I sure can't. But I can zoom into any fermion in the structure and visualize it's internal assembly point charge path history. Now imagine the incredibly complex net potential field!

The next step is to look at the products of the decay of a Pu-238 atom. Photons? alpha particles? Beta particles? Neutrons? The transmuted result atom. We may need to consider the Higgs assembly aether sea. Then we might trace those products on the main reaction sequence. Our simulations will be able to trace the point charge paths of every single point charge in any reaction or any reaction network. Here is a primitive Bing Ai artwork suggestive of a point charge paths in a particle assembly. Keep in mind that particle assemblies are micro machines with point charges playing different roles in the machine and operating at vastly different scales of energy.

My intuition tells me that even processes we consider advanced technology, like RTGs, are Rube Goldberg machines with an incredible amount of inefficiency. That's good news from the perspective of technologists because once they understand point charge theory they will realize the incredible opportunities that arise from understanding the source code of nature. It will become possible to advance technology at an extremely rapid rate, tapping into the shielded energies in particle assemblies and even spacetime. We are permeated by the energetic raw materials of nature, which no doubt can be tapped for the benefit of intelligent life and our ecosystems.

I find the orbital and molecular visualization tools Chemtube3d and Avogadro to be fascinating. I wonder if there are commercial software tools that take the visual modeling and animation to more advanced levels. NPQG investigates the implementation of GR and QM with standard model particles implemented as assemblies of point charges and q=|e/6| with velocity that can exceed potential speed. I am imagining the electron orbitals from Chemtube3d where each electron is itself a machine like assembly of point charges with vastly different orbital energy scales. Electron : 6 weak q- in polar regions of a triply nested q-/q+ orbiting strong binaries. The tool I am imagining would allow zooming in to any scale, turning on path traces, shading the spherically emanating and fading potential at each point on the path history, and best of all somehow illustrating the superposition of all the potentials and the shielding of energy as a result. Wow, now that would be awesome. Logarithmic labeling would be awesome too for orbital radii, velocity, PE, and KE. And probably some kind of color scale for the point charge path traces to visually represent v < field speed, v=field speed (symmetry breaking point), and v > field speed (self action region).
