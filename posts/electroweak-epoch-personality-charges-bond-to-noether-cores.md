Let’s remap the Big Bang cosmology timeline to the point charge universe! This series has already covered higher energy epochs listed below.

| _The **electroweak epoch** was the period in the evolution of the early universe when the **temperature** of the universe had fallen enough that the strong force separated from the electroweak interaction. — Wikipedia   _    | The strong interaction emerges from the polar vortices of orbiting point potential binaries. For the strong interaction to become distinct from the electroweak interaction requires that some binaries, presumably those which have dissipated more energy, have decayed to free up individual electrino and positrino point charges.    |
| _The temperature in the electroweak epoch was high enough\* for electromagnetism and the weak interaction to remain merged into a single electroweak interaction.   _   _\*Above the critical temperature for electroweak symmetry breaking (159.5±1.5 GeV in the Standard Model of particle physics). — Wikipedia_ | This appears to be a stage where there are individual electrinos and positrinos which were products of binary decay, yet those electrinos and positrinos have not yet bonded into the polar vortices of Noether cores.      This process may be quite complex and require simulation to determine when each flavor of generation I fermion precipitates out of solution and remains a stable assembly. We know from the variation in apparent energies of standard model particles that there are specific energy levels associated with the binaries in the Noether cores for each type of fermion, i.e., the {electron, muon, tau} nest or the {up, charm, top} nest. |
| Eventually the electroweak epoch comes to an end when fermions form. | The free point charges have bonded in the polar vortices of binaries. The polar personality charges **individually** implement the weak force. As a **set**, the six polar personality charges around a Noether core comprise the assembly charge and determine its electromagnetic characteristics. |
| _Some cosmologists place the electroweak epoch at the start of the inflationary epoch, approximately 10−36 seconds after the Big Bang. Others place it at approximately 10−32 seconds after the Big Bang when the potential energy of the inflaton field that had driven the inflation of the universe during the inflationary epoch was released, filling the universe with a dense, hot quark–gluon plasma._ \[W\] | Simulation of this process in the proper galaxy local SMBH context will enable scientists to make precise calculations of the temperature and energies at which the various steps in the electroweak "epoch" occur.      The inflaton appears to map to the binary assembly.      Scientists may need to choose another term rather than "epoch" or reframe the term to the scope of galaxy local process. |
| _Particle interactions in this phase were energetic enough to create large numbers of exotic particles, including W and Z bosons and Higgs bosons. As the universe expanded and cooled, interactions became less energetic and when the universe was about 10−12 seconds old, W and Z bosons ceased to be created at observable rates. \[W\]_ | This makes sense. Essentially you have a soup of binaries and variously nested Noether cores along with individual point charges flying around. Presumably reaction rates are high and shielding of energy plays a role in reducing reactivity as the maelstrom inflates or expands. |
| _The remaining W and Z bosons decayed quickly, and the weak interaction became a short-range force in the following quark epoch._ \[W\] | This appears to indicate that the personality charges that have settled into the polar vortices achieve stably bonded state as reactions subsided.      The W and Z bosons themselves then become ephemeral configurations in the process of a reaction. In some cases these reactions involve Higgs assemblies as a reactant which then assume an ephemeral role as a W or Z boson. I brainstormed on this topic here : [W and Z Boson Reaction Provenance](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2022/12/17/w-and-z-boson-reaction-provenance/). |

Examining the point charge implementation diagram, we see the Noether cores along the left side. These combine with individual point charges bonding in different flavors as shown on the top row. The intersection of row and column shows the emergent generation I fermion assemblies. On the right side we see the bosons. Note how the W and Z bosons are only slight variations from the Higgs. This variation occurs as an ephemeral assembly during weak interactions.

With our point charge foundation in place, the electroweak epoch is described with a parsimonious and logical reaction chain.
