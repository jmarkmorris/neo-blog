Let's brainstorm the mapping of quantum chromo-dynamic's **gluon** to the vortices of two coupled binaries and possibly include their personality charges. As a refresh, all standard matter assemblies have a nested tri-binary Noether core. That includes spacetime aether assemblies in a Higgs formation. There is no shortage of binaries to couple with if the conditions are suitable.

| _Gluon (Wikipedia)_ | NPQG |
| --- | --- |
| _A gluon is an elementary particle._ | A gluon is a point charge binary. |
| _In QCD gauges are used to model different energy levels in a particle assembly._ | In NPQG we model each point charge with provenance for its potential energy and kinetic energy along its path. |
| _A gluon acts as the exchange particle for the strong force between quarks._ | The strong force is implemented by the polar vortices of the Noether core. Weak point charges bound in the poles may play a role. |
| _This is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles._ | The weak charges in the binary polar regions may be the transducers of energy to and from the Noether core binaries. If so, then the weak charge energy may flow to a Higgs aether particle which transforms into a photon. I'd say there are some commonalities, but its too early to say analogous. |
| _Gluons bind quarks together, forming hadrons such as protons and neutrons._ | I am thinking that flux tubes correspond to the polar vortices of the Noether core binaries. Can binaries couple across Noether cores? Is a personality charge required in the pole for coupling? There are many questions that simulation should be able to answer. |
| _Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction._      _This is unlike the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than quantum electrodynamics (QED)._ | Considering the weak charges as a factor here, each quark has an asymmetry in polar charges that can map in three ways to the binaries. This is my conjecture on the implementation of color charge.      I think a point charge provenance analysis will shed light on the dynamical geometry of mediation for both the electromagnetic photon case and the strong interaction gluon case. |
| _The gluon is a vector boson, which means, like the photon, it has a spin of 1._ | In NPQG bosons are recognized as an assembly state with coaxial alignment of all orbits, which yields a spin of 1. Fermions have unaligned orbital axes leading to a figure eight precession with spin 1/2. |
| _Massless gauge bosons like the gluon have only two polarization states because gauge invariance requires the polarization to be transverse to the direction that the gluon is traveling._      _In quantum field theory, unbroken gauge invariance requires that gauge bosons have zero mass._      _Experiments limit the gluon's rest mass (if any) to less than a few MeV/c2. The gluon has negative intrinsic parity._ | I'm not clear on why QCD says gluons are massless. Normally their energy is largely shielded but not in the case of the strong and weak interactions. Is it related to the Z and W bosons which are considered massy being in intermediate states where the formerly shielded gluon energy is apparent and observable?      I don't know how to map two polarization states to a single gluon. However, if we are talking about two gluon binaries coupled with a flux tube then those could correspond to orbital axes or orbital phase. |
| _Massive spin-1 particles have three polarization states,_ | The W and Z bosons are massive spin-1 pseudo-assemblies. They do have three binaries and each could be in a different phase. Is there is a mapping? They also may be revealing three slightly different orbital axes. |
| _Gluons are subject to the color charge phenomena. Quarks carry three types of color charge; antiquarks carry three types of anticolor. Gluons may be thought of as carrying both color and anticolor. This gives nine possible combinations of color and anticolor in gluons. The following is a list of those combinations.   _   _red–antired ![r\bar{r}](images/e386d1584c6290ff30d48cbd445586ab7a1fd9f2)   red–antigreen ![r\bar{g}](images/5c5c10a072ae0b6676f15d33cc28a5e1c0421f53)   red–antiblue ![r\bar{b}](images/ee94382c30b2ae9cd8342b54c206d09d303c6389)   green–antired ![g\bar{r}](images/7ee746ceded41438c55c1b9b879a2c935e49f2a8)   green–antigreen ![g\bar{g}](images/a3310397b9c4699a61c0551f04b33327875dfec8)   green–antiblue ![g\bar{b}](images/d2e855e9457da7ac138c257d6b15a67865d696d2)   blue–antired ![b\bar{r}](images/dfe209a2a50ece5dbabbbea6183571f5031760bf)   blue–antigreen ![b\bar{g}](images/01b390b5c304cd2a1d063132abaadd1f0e832df5)   blue–antiblue ![b\bar{b}](images/5047b6e5096de6a8677592b662b123884b6240e3)_  | It seems as if QCD is defining the gluon as the flux tube and the type and color of vortex, but not the binary itself. That sort of makes sense given quantum theory isn't based on point charges.      So with gluon defined this way, then yes, these represent the possible couplings of the colors of a quark and anti-quark, where color is defined by the charge assignment combination.      I don't yet see how the three pro quarks in a nucleon yield a virtual anti-quark. |
| _These are not the actual color states of observed gluons, but rather effective states. To correctly understand how they are combined, it is necessary to consider the mathematics of color charge in more detail._ |  |
| _The stable strongly interacting particles (such as the proton and the neutron, i.e. hadrons) observed in nature are "colorless", More precisely they are in a "color singlet" state, which is mathematically analogous to a spin singlet state. Such states allow interaction with other color singlets, but not with other color states; because long-range gluon interactions do not exist, this illustrates that gluons in the singlet state do not exist either.   The color singlet state is : ( ![r\bar{r}](images/e386d1584c6290ff30d48cbd445586ab7a1fd9f2)+ ![g\bar{g}](images/a3310397b9c4699a61c0551f04b33327875dfec8) + ![b\bar{b}](images/5047b6e5096de6a8677592b662b123884b6240e3)) / sqrt(3)   If one could measure the color of the state, there would be equal probabilities of it being red–antired, blue–antiblue, or green–antigreen._ | I don't know how to physically map this insight.      Does this mean that in a hadron that all vortices are coupled and none are available to react? |
| There are eight remaining independent color states in QCD, which correspond to the "eight types" or "eight colors" of gluons. Because states can be mixed together, there are many ways of presenting these states, which are known as the "color octet". One commonly used list is shown below. These are equivalent to the Gell-Mann matrices. The critical feature of these particular eight states is that they are linearly independent, and also independent of the singlet state, hence 32 − 1 = 23. There is no way to add any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to add them to make _( ![r\bar{r}](images/e386d1584c6290ff30d48cbd445586ab7a1fd9f2)+ ![g\bar{g}](images/a3310397b9c4699a61c0551f04b33327875dfec8) + ![b\bar{b}](images/5047b6e5096de6a8677592b662b123884b6240e3))_ the forbidden singlet state. | I don't know how to physically map this insight.      It sounds like there are nine ways that two binaries can try to couple and that eight of them don't lead to anything stable. One pattern leads to hadrons. Why is that pattern more stable? Keep in mind that this is all based upon dynamical geometry. |

The figure shows my imagination of two binaries coupling. What happens with iso and anti coupling orbits is unknown at this point. The conjecture is that gluon flux tubes map to the pair of vortices, but not to the binaries. If this is correct, then gluons are not stand alone particle assemblies. Instead they are the Dirac sphere vortices from the two orbiting binaries and may include personality charges that could swap places. This explains some of the rows in the differential comparison chart above.

Here is a video with visualizations of gluon behaviour.
