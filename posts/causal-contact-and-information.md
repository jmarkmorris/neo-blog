The point potential architecture is amazingly powerful, and it dispenses with the major issues, problems, and tensions in physics and cosmology as if they never existed.

- In a universe with no known beginning in time or space, every point potential is in continuous causal contact with every other point potential.

- Meanwhile the point potential maintains its continuous sphere stream.

- All point potential relationships are well defined geometrically by fiat, each point potential is intersecting continuous sphere streams from all partners.

- As far as the point potential is concerned, sphere streams are "emit and forget".

- Each point potential seeds the universe with information about its polarity, location, and velocity, all in an absolute Euclidean (t,x,y,z) frame.
    - Only our absolute virtual observer knows the full information in the sphere stream.

- When a point potential has exceeded field speed on its path causal contact is nuanced.
    - For each path segment where the point potential velocity exceeds field speed, the relationship situation is nuanced and fascinating.
    
    - Self-contact occurs when self-velocity exceeds field speed, i.e., the point potential outpaces its own historical sphere stream.

Let's consider the relationship between two point potentials. Due to symmetries and superposition, the receiver discerns a geometry that describes the possible locations in time and space as well as the (vector) velocity of the emitter. Potential (charge) polarity is not determined, as there are symmetric solutions.

The **_information content received_** from a Dirac sphere by an intersecting point potential is:

- The **line** from receiver sphere stream intersection to the point of emission.
    - Say the receiver is at **_s = 0_**, then the emitter is on the line defined by **_s <> s’ = (x,y,z)._**
    
    - Information: **_3 real numbers continuously in time_**
    
    - Hence a need for efficient path modeling in analytics and simulation, by use case.
        - With assemblies lending themselves to regular repetitive behaviour, simulation models can blend analytical, statistical, and Monte Carlo scenarios.

- The **unknown** potential polarity:   the charge of the emitter may be a
    - **_+|q|_** point potential in one direction along the line
    
    - **_\-|q|_** point potential in the opposite direction along the line.
    
    - Information: **_1 bit with unknown polarity_**  (i.e., a hidden variable?)

- A **function** defining the relationship of distance and velocity of the emitter.
    - Emission at time t is q for vt\=0 and q/|vt| for |vt|>0.
    
    - Emission decreases with radius, i.e., q/(|v|r)
    
    - **_If |q|=1 we know that location s' on the line have characteristics v=1/r._**

Let's review some terminology.

- A point potential emits a continuous Dirac sphere stream with magnitude |q| at r0 = @t0 = 0

- @ is the field speed of each emitted potential sphere stream where rnow = @tnow

- All relationships are continuous in time with no known beginning nor end.

- Each Dirac sphere sweeps through all space inside the sphere, from r = 0, to r = rnow,

Now let's explore causal contact.

- **Case I: There is continuous causal contact between each point potential and every other point potential**.
    - For periods where the emitter has had a velocity v, such that |v| > @ the receiver may perceive sphere streams from the emitter that intersect or overlap.
    
    - _I find it challenging to visualize the topological nesting of sphere streams from the same emitter, but since we have superposition, this requires no additional physics._

- **Case II: The causal contact from a point potential and itself, i.e., cis self-contact.**
    - When point potential velocity v <= @ for enough time that any prior sphere streams emitted when v > @ have passed.
        - There is no self-action and hence no causal self-contact.
        
        - The point potential only intersects its initial r = 0 emission at time t = tnow
        
        - When point potential velocity v = @, we a nuanced special case.
    
    - For v > @, where @ is the speed of potential the emitted potential sphere stream
        - The point potential may intersect past sphere streams that it has emitted.

**_Terminology_**. We can analyze and predict nature as one to one relationships between all point potentials, including the self. Superposition is an essential property of the physics of point potentials. Each point potential relationship can be classified as trans or cis, ala chemistry.

- **Positive-Positive (_Cis_)**:
    - Each receiver experiences **repelling action** away from the emission point.

- **Positive-Negative (_Trans_)**:
    - Each receiver experiences **attracting action** towards the emission point.

- **Negative-Negative (_Cis_)**:
    - Each receiver experiences **repelling action** away from the emission point

This post has covered causal contact and information at the foundational level of nature.

_Brainstorm: What if we define r = 1 where y = 1/x = 1, i.e., the symmetry point on the 1/r curve?_

- _It would be convenient if the symmetry breaking point in the 1/r curve corresponds to an emitter starting with v=0 from distance = "infinity" then reaching r = 1 with v=|@|._
