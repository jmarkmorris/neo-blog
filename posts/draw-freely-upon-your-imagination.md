This is such a wonderful quote! Why don’t particle physicists and astrophysicists/cosmologists think this way?! It is so tragic to see them so lost and in crisis, especially when the solution is so obvious. It’s the priors! You have interpretive errors in many priors. Go ➾ 1870.

_A few comments I made on the PBS Space Time Discord :_

I started to wonder if or how frame invariance relates to my Noether cores, which are the energy conservation engines with features like energy banker, stretchy ruler, variable clock, perfect black body, and more. A Gen I Noether core is included with every Gen 1 Fermion (neutrino, electron, up quark, down quark, and the anti versions) as well as the photon, the W and Z bosons. Higgs may describe the aether which I think is a soup of extremely redshifted and massy photons and neutrinos. Whatever, other than gluon, they all have a Gen 1 Noether core of three point charge binaries at different energy scales. Here's a picture. I still haven't figure out how to depict a Noether core, since the orders of magnitude difference in energy and radius may make even the second binary a speck on a non-log chart. The third binary may not even be visible from the second. Anyway this is also the mechanism for fermion generations. CERN blows away the outer binary, now it is Gen II. Blow away the 2nd binary and now you are left with a Gen III fermion. No wonder Gen II and III aren't stable - they are missing containment.

What kinds of things might the JW Space Telescope find that would challenge or even falsify LCDM? That would be a great topic, because it is framed where you can speculate on perfectly reasonable things that people might wonder about. For example, what if JWST observes galaxies or other events that are simply far too old for LCDM? Then what? I mean, it was sort of convenient that the lowest energy photons we can detect from the most distant space and time are 13.77B year old photons, wasn't it? I suppose if you are a believer in the Big Bang it was a confirmation, a sign from the heavens. I presume there are several other known ways the JWST could observe things that would upset LCDM or other theories. Please consider.
