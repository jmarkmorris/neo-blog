Dr. Lawrence Krauss posted a fascinating series of "5 Minute Physics" videos circa April/May 2020. They are filmed in and around his Oregon home, which is in a lovely woods with a creek running through it, and this yields a very pleasing viewing experience. In this post I'll review Dr. Krauss's videos and compare and contrast **NPQG**.

**Episode 15** : Dr. Krauss begins with a discussion of kinetic energy and potential energy. Potential energy is a bizarre concept if you think about it and probably should have been a clue to scientists. Why is potential energy so abstract, especially when it comes to gravitational potential energy? What is the physical mechanism that implements potential energy? I am working on articulating this for NPQG and it relates to shell energy of standard matter particles vs. the shell energy of neighboring spacetime æther particles. I haven't yet decided if we should introduce new terminology and get away from this nebulous abstract concept of potential energy. I am a practical person, so I'd like to know where the actual energy is physically implemented! I won't comment further because I plan on rewriting how we think about these issues with the insights from NPQG.

**Episode 16** : This episode talks about virtual particles (again!). I find this whole concept so incredibly frustrating. I seems to me like a huge abdication of responsibility for physicists who should really strive understand what is actually happening in nature. Throwing up your hands in the air and saying "virtual particles" is a huge failure in cognition.

**Episode 17** : Basics about orbits and gravity and mass. Towards the end Dr. Krauss talks about the puzzle of galaxy rotation curves. It is a great disappointment to me that physicists have not properly enumerated the possibilities that could lead to the observed galaxy rotation curves. For example, in NPQG, black holes can shield mass if matter-energy forms a Planck core. Furthermore, with jetting AGN SMBH being the physical implementation of the Big Bang, inflation, and expansion this flow of new spacetime æther outward from the galaxy may have something to do with galaxy rotation curves. Lastly, we have all the new matter-energy formed from the jets and that may also have an effect on galaxy rotation curves. In other words, mass very close to the black hole at some point disappears and then reappears far away where it has far less influence.

**Episode 18** : This episode is about entanglement in quantum mechanics, which is also called 'spooky action at a distance'. In NPQG these issues are hardly mysterious, and in fact they are mundane. Oh, I think I may have finally figured out the flaw in their logic. QM era physicists really believe in quantum uncertainty as they define it. Oh my, there is no such thing. We are talking point charges and conservation of momentum and energy and so forth. There is no uncertainty at all in an isolated system.

Now, that said, the reason the world is random and we have free will is that you never know what wave is coming in from afar. So you can have a tough decision and in your mind it is very close, and you actually could go either way. How do you think that is decided? Gravitational waves and fields from distant sources can cause the decision to tip one way or the other. These arriving waves are the root cause of uncertainty. Another huge mystery solved and narrative corrected.

I hope the readers who make it through all of these videos and my responses will appreciate Dr. Krauss's series as well as see how the GR-QM-ΛCDM era will be supplanted by NPQG.
