> In cosmology, the **cosmological constant problem** or **vacuum catastrophe** is the substantial disagreement between the observed values of vacuum energy density (the small value of the cosmological constant) and the much larger theoretical value of zero-point energy suggested by quantum field theory.
> 
> Depending on the Planck energy cutoff and other factors, the quantum vacuum energy contribution to the effective cosmological constant is calculated to be between 50 and as much as 120 orders of magnitude greater than observed, a state of affairs described by physicists as "the largest discrepancy between theory and experiment in all of science" and "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics".

What happens above and below black hole event horizons? With decreasing radius to the center of the black hole, energy density increases. I imagine a spherical layer cake of increasing point potential density and whatever point potential assemblies can form at those densities. Assemblies may have a better chance of stability via stealth and/or small size.

Spacetime aether is emitted by black holes having the requisite conditions. Some aether assemblies may react and create a plasma of standard model precursor assemblies. In this cauldron survival largely depends on shielding. Shielded assemblies or sub-assemblies are very lightly interactive. Spacetime assemblies have very high energy but are nearly entirely shielded by superposition! They are also extremely small, with radii far below that of fermions. Fermions Noether cores have less energy in both apparent and shielded forms, thus they are much larger. One way to look at this is that the fermion standard model particle assemblies are the emergent patterns of lower energy point potentials that can be stable in a sea of nearly transparent high energy spacetime assemblies. You might imagine this like ping pong balls floating in sea of water molecules.

It stands to reason that the "pressure" components of Einstein's equations may relate to spacetime aether acting to crush standard model particle assemblies which have a higher volumetric displacement.

The surrounding and permeating spacetime aether contains an enormous amount of energy that far exceeds our standard model particles. Essentially spacetime aether is an incredibly high energy configuration of point potential assemblies that is incredibly difficult to observe directly. What we call standard model particle assemblies are the low energy bubbles that form. Like the bubbles in a soda pop glass. It seems entirely perplexing to think this way until you realize what is going on.

All of our standard model particles are assemblies of point potentials that are capable of surviving in a sea of incredibly high energy spacetime aether assembly clusters. The radii of the scalable Noether cores in spacetime aether is extremely small. The standard model that is quarks and electrons that comprise the universe are merely bubbles of point potential assemblies in a low energy configuration. Yet somehow it is stable in a sea of spacetime assemblies, because they are in stealth mode. They are at such high energy that passing point potentials at distant radii have little influence.

There are certain quantum theorists that were on the right track when asserting that there should be an incredibly high energy background. There actually is!!! And it is nearly non-interacting with stable standard model particles. There is a small redshift tax however.

How shall we conceive of the Noether cores of spacetime (see left side of diagram) that couple with free point potentials and assembly fragments to emerge via reactions and stabilize as combinations of standard model particles, assemblies, such as protons, neutrons, electrons, photons, and neutrinos?

One metaphor is that standard model particle assemblies are surfers of spacetime assemblies. At every level our fermion Noether cores (which are decorated with personality charges) are bathed in the Noether cores of spacetime aether. It is in one sense a sea of Noether core based assemblies passing by and through and jostling with each other.  The Noether cores are such an amazing emergent assembly. It seems that they exclusively occupy of a volume of time and space except when they approach very high speeds and take a more planar form.

Some Noether cores (which and why?) sweep up decoupled point potentials in their poles and form metastable assemblies that mix in a soup that may produce fermions and the stable particles of the standard model. Those Noether cores and personality potentials make fermions, e.g., electrons and quarks which go on to make neutrons and protons. 

These are in one sense emergent reaction products that may interact, but they are also massy matter beginning the inexorable tug towards denser spacetime assemblies, towards an SMBH one way or another in cycles of cycles. Fermion Noether cores have relatively low apparent and shielded energy in most environments. Spacetime Noether cores emerging from SMBH are very high energy. Noether core based assemblies exchange energy via ephemeral couplings with each other.

Photon assemblies fly through spacetime assemblies. Since photons are moving quickly the spacetime assemblies have little time to react in advance of the photon passing. Most interactions are distorted in a geometrical sense. The net energy tax on the photons leads to a reduction in their frequency as they travel, an effect we call redshift.

Certainly, photons and neutrinos and some other assemblies pass between galaxies. However, much of the local matter in a galaxy has descended from galaxy SMBHs, mostly the local one or ones that have merged with the local galaxy. As the energy of the Noether cores emitted by the SMBH is dissipated there are phases where they couple with nearby point potentials that have lesser energy.

All of the orbs and collections of assemblies are the natural function of space time to clean up and recycle anomalies. Why? Standard model particle assemblies, such as the fermions, have higher apparent energy than spacetime aether assemblies. The apparent energy of standard model assemblies excites spacetime and this causes spacetime aether assemblies to deflate and possibly become oblate around dense matter. Excited spacetime shrinks, drawing in more nearby spacetime aether with a gradient. Thus, spacetime aether naturally acquires the moguls and saddles that sweep the popcorn kernels of the standard model assemblies inward in the recycling system.

Let's make a list of assemblies in speculative order of increasing volumetric density of point potentials and the energy they carry. Of course it varies with radius of the orb, and we will need scientists to characterize the various orbs and their content by radius.

1. free electron

3. free proton (H nucleus)

5. space dust

7. comets, asteroids, etc

9. planets

11. stars

13. neutron stars

15. quark stars

17. neutrinos

19. photons

21. spacetime assemblies

23. black holes

25. super-massive black holes

Items 1 through 8 are based on fermions which by nature are Noether cores surrounded by weak personality potentials. This weak layer makes the volume of the assembly larger, and thus the volumetric densities lower.

Items 10 through 13 are Noether core or binary based with very high volumetric densities.

Item 9 the neutrino is like a photon that didn't quite launch as a boson.

_The particles we imagine in the standard model are lower energy configurations of point potentials that bind together within a soup of nearly transparent **high energy spacetime** aether._
