In physics news, [Scientists Create Matter From Pure Light, Proving the Breit-Wheeler Effect](https://science-news.co/scientists-create-matter-from-pure-light-proving-the-breit-wheeler-effect/).

> _The Breit-Wheeler effect, postulated as early as 1934, describes the conversion of light into matter. With the theory physicists Gregory Breit and John Wheeler were able to prove that when two high-energy photons collide, a positron and an electron arise, i.e., matter is formed. An experiment has now proven this theory for the first time. In the context of his special theory of relativity, Einstein described the natural law of the equivalence of mass and energy (E = mcÂ²) as early as 1905. According to this, energy and matter are equivalent and can be converted into one another. One direction of matter and energy is omnipresent. It takes place permanently in the sun, for example when atomic nuclei fuse and energy is given off in the form of radiation._

Let's take a look at this reaction from the point of view of the point charge geometry of the photon, electron, and positron.

- First note that each of the particles in the reaction has 12 point charges. Point charges are immutable and therefore conserved.

- We see that the reaction is essentially a swap of point charges between the particles. Each photon is a 6:6 assembly and the products have 6:0 and 0:6 personality layers. This is consistent with charge conservation.

- We don't know the role of surrounding spacetime aether structures. In some reactions the aether contributes reactants or consumes products. It appears in this case that the reaction may proceed without exchanging point charges with the aether.

- A positron includes an anti-Noether core. The anti-Noether core must come from one of the photons.

- How do Noether core charges transform from two neutral photons into distinct electron and positron personalities charges?

We don't know much about how the collision and reaction are choreographed in terms of the provenance of specific point charges and their traced paths. We might guess that the binaries entering in Noether cores often exit as binaries in Noether cores. Likewise for the point charges in the personality layers. A goal is to simulate this reaction using a Monte-Carlo technique and establish the individual paths for each and every point charge involved. Furthermore, scientists will be able to explore this reaction in incredible detail and discover the nuances that may lead to new and useful technologies.

We know that photons present no mass, yet still have energy via E=hf. But which frequency? Does the frequency of a photon correspond to the outer binary frequency, the middle, or the inner? I'm presuming for now that it is the outer, lowest energy binary.

Is it possible that the internal binaries in the planar photon may be shielded? That is still a bit odd to think about but appears to be what nature is revealing through NPQG. The implications are quite profound. If this is true, then photons have a **HUGE** amount of energy shielded in the Gen II and Gen III binaries and when a relatively low energy reaction strips off the outer Gen I binary, the Gen II and III binaries may react or sail on by, similarly to neutrinos sailing right through common low energy matter. High energy corresponds to the binary radius scaling by contraction with a range of _at least_ 20 orders of magnitude from nucleons at 10\-15 to the true geometric point charge binaries with a maximum curvature occurring at a binary orbital radius of around 10\-35 meters..
