Physics and cosmology are in crisis due to a large number of paradoxes and unsolved problems from the eras of general relativity (GR), quantum mechanics (QM), and the lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmology model. However, **the greatest problem facing scientists is the set of false narratives which permeate their thinking**.

The narrative of Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity (**𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚**) describes a natural universe that emerges from a 4D Euclidean space and time. The universe contains a density of immutable, energetic, charged Planck scale spheres that construct all matter and spacetime æther.

𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 explores this foundation for nature and how emergence could produce a universe remarkably like our own, including the observables of GR, QM, and ΛCDM. 𝗡𝗣𝗤𝗚 requires a transformation of various narratives of physics and cosmology, but in many ways these are geometric topological transformations that are straightforward and ease the solution to the tensions, open questions, and paradoxes.

A first transformation implements much of Einstein's spacetime geometry with a particle based structure — an æther of electrino and positrino particles perhaps in the form of one or more composite particles, such as photons or neutrinos or other particles that may exist in each locality. As particles of spacetime æther gain energy the electrinos and positrinos in their orbitals increase in speed and through electromechanical action this causes the orbital radius to contract. The speed of the electrinos and positrinos in relation to the orbital wavelength leads to the implementation of time for the particle. Likewise as particles lose energy the orbital speed decreases and the orbital radius increases. This mechanism is of course the implementation of Einstein's curvy spacetime with length contraction and time dilation.

A second transformation reconciles the reasoning of Einstein and the randomness of quantum mechanics. It turns out that nature both does and does not play dice with the universe. How can this be? Reactions are deterministic in isolation. However the spacetime æther substrate is an input to all reactions as well, and that æther is carrying electromechanical energy waves which can tip a reaction one way or another. The arriving waves at the moment and location of a reaction may be from origins outside of causal contact. This thought transformation reconciles one struggle between Einstein and QM.

A third transformation reconciles the inflationary big bang and expanding universe as topologically equivalent to a galaxy local inflationary mini-bang and expansion process. This is fun because it involves a riddle. How can spacetime be expanding throughout the universe yet the universe is not expanding as a whole?

The trick is that we transform from a single inflationary big bang to SMBH driven independent, ongoing, distributed galaxy local deflate, crunch, mini-bang inflation, and galaxy local expansion in opposition to neighbor galaxies. Here is another visual for this transformation.

A fourth transformation provides an origin for the fields of quantum field theory (QFT). The origin of every field is an electrino or positrino particle engaged in classical electro-mechanical physics. The implementation of this transformation is made complex by formation of structure upon structure, yet the sum is the whole of the parts, by conservation of electrinos, positrinos, energy, momentum, and charge. You'll note that the new concept of conservation of electrinos and positrinos individually is quite powerful.

I've introduced you to four of the major narrative transformations that NPQG applies to GR, QM, ΛCDM, and QFT. There are many other transformations in narrative thought, logic, and mathematics of various import (e.g., entropy and information in NPQG!). The transformations often result in narrative that is natural and understandable in the universe imagined by NPQG. These additional transformations and more are explored here on my blog where I continue to advance the knowledge around NPQG.

All matter-energy in the universe are based upon two flavors of fundamental particles — immutable point charges which are equal and opposite, |e/6| charge. Let's call them the electrino and positrino.

Immutable point charges are jetted as Planck point charge plasma from the core of galactic supermassive black holes (SMBH). As the plasma cools, decays, inflates, and reacts it forms standard matter. Some of the standard matter is low energy neutral particles of spacetime æther. SMBH standard matter-energy recycling explains galaxy rotation curves. The big bang theory and one time inflation are no longer valid. Dark matter is explainable with new mechanisms in NPQG. The æther cooling explains local expansion which is balanced by processes that serve to contract particles by heating or cooling on either side of a symmetry where particles are at their maximum size.

Spacetime æther particles implement gravity by exchanging energy losslessly with nearby matter-energy. The gradient in æther energy is the "field" that creates the "force of gravity". Quantum mechanics tries to look at standard matter without knowledge of æther particles. QM - fail. General relativity effects can be explained by the change in æther particle size and frequency as a function of energy. This implies that the fine structure "constant" varies! Gravitational lensing may be considered as the refraction of standard physics. Space contraction and time dilation near dense matter are natural effects of the energy stored. The math is general relativity is highly accurate until near Planck scale, but narrative is wrong.

Overall OUR universe is a giant recycling machine. Matter-energy recycles through Planck particle phase in black holes (at least the galactic center ones), and standard matter including æther decay back to energy and matter-energy everywhere, but probably more quickly near the SMBH jets and the bubble surface.

The spacetime æther based model and narrative is logical and straightforward. Of course, experimental results stand. Much of the math and theory can be rearranged and refactored to fit the NPQG narrative. NPQG is isomorphic to the patchwork quilt of GR, QM, and LCDM less their fantastical interpretations.
