Imagine that spacetime is an æther of low apparent energy particle assemblies arranged in Higgs clusters. The potential wave of the binaries comprising the Noether cores of local assemblies would interact with an ebb and flow of continuous energy, not a discrete transfer of energy. The past potential field of each assembly will cause action on local point charges which will change their potential and kinetic energy. Yet the potential from each of the Noether core binaries alternates causing a rebounding action a short time later. This alternating pulsing of potential may impart a root mean square excitation type energy (needs more research). The increase in the apparent energy of spacetime æther from the local presence of higher matter-energy causes the aether assemblies to contract. Gravity is the force on matter from the gradient of spacetime æther energy.

All 'presenting' matter-energy particles are pulsing energy into the æther, and those waves travel at the local speed of light **c** and decrease in magnitude with the square of the distance. Every particle pushes energy, they receive energy back. It is an alternating energy flux. This is related, but distinct from a gravitational wave tsunami as a result of a high energy collision (BH-BH, BH-NS, NS-NS) where the spacetime æther particles experience changes in size and displacement. Some particles in the universe don't participate in this dance. Those are particles on the interior of a Planck core inside supermassive black holes (SMBH). Particles interior to a Planck core can not present their energy (mass) because they are at maximum energy and their neighbors are too.

Let's use $latex \\mathbf{F=GM\_{1}M\_{2}/r^{2}} &s=1$ to show gravitational interaction of two particles where M1 is the pass of particle 1 and M2 is the mass of particle 2, and this can easily be extended to collections or bodies of matter up to a fairly large size. Neutron stars (NS) and black holes (BH) will be considered separately. Particle 1 pulses energy to the spacetime æther. That energy spreads out at local $latex \\mathbf{c^{2}} &s=1$. Why $latex \\mathbf{c^{2}} &s=1$? We are dealing with a spherical wave, so surface area is where the energy gets spread. What is the surface area of a sphere? It is $latex \\mathbf{4 \\pi r^{2}} &s=1$. So that is where some of these numbers in the physics equations arise naturally. You'll notice I said local **c**. **c** is not a constant. **c** depends on local permittivity and permeability of the spacetime æther which depend on energy - aka temperature - of the æther neighborhood. Then particle 1 receives an energy pulse back from the spacetime æther. So that is a sine wave. No net energy was transferred. However, particle 1 averages root mean square energy outstanding over that wave cycle. The RMS energy outstanding $latex \\mathbf{E\_{1}=m\_{1}c^{2}} &s=1$. Local c. So particle 1 averages E1 outstanding.

Meanwhile particle 2 is doing the same thing, and has mass M2 which is given by RMS Energy E2 outstanding.

Now imagine graphing the extremely low apparent energy of spacetime around and between these particle assemblies. Each particle would experience a higher spacetime aether energy in the direction towards the other particle. It turns out that particles experience a force towards higher energy spacetime aether and the steeper that gradient, the higher the force of gravity.

Spacetime is implemented by an æther which we can imagine as a gas of assemblies such as Higgs, ultimately redshifted photons and neutrinos, and perhaps other detritus. In low gravity free space spacetime æther has relatively low apparent energy and gradient compared to on Earth, or near any other more massive object. That is why we call free space zero-G but that of course is an exaggeration because there is a always a net gravitational tug in one direction or another no matter how small.

The image above shows a visualization of gravity wells of various solar system orbs. Inverting this graph the peaks would correspond to spacetime aether energy. Aether assemblies change shape and size with energy and energy gradient and this is the implementation of Einstein's curvy stretchy geometry. The steepness, slope, or more correctly gradient, of spacetime energy determines the strength of gravity.
