Consider that the Universe is highly influenced by an emergent pseudo-Riemannian spacetime æther, which is permeating a Euclidean time and 3D space, and that this æther is formed from energetic, immutable, equal and opposite, charged, unit potential point charges. The universe is physically based upon two geometries, one foundational Euclidean geometry and one dynamical and emergent pseudo-Riemannian geometry! The emergent geometry of spacetime isn't a **_pure_** geometry - it is a set of fields and assemblies defined by discrete energetic point charges and their parameters.

If nature were an adversary in a game that challenges you to understand the foundations of nature itself, you'd really have to admire nature and how at the underlying geometry level it played this intelligence trick on us. Talk about dynamical. I mean this is dynamical from the get-go. Who would expect a second dominant geometry directly on top of the first? Well, that is what nature does.

Stated as a narrative, the underlying space or volume in the universe is exactly as you would expect. It does not curve and stretch ala Einstein. It is exactly how we think of space as flat and three dimensional. Time is simply linear and forward moving. As far as we know, the universe has no beginning or end in time or space.

In reality, point charges are considered as geometrical points in time and space. I visualize them as immutable blue and red spherical marbles, all exactly the same, except the blue ones have a negative electric charge and the red ones have a positive electric charge. The magnitude of that charge is 1/6 the charge of what you know as an electron. Immutability emerges because orbiting point charges may approach no closer than one half the Planck length, which is on the order of 10\-35 meters.

Point charges assemble into the standard model particles including Higgs clusters which implement Einstein's spacetime, for which Einstein provided only a mathematical geometry. Einstein did not provide a physical implementation. Einstein didn't understand that simple Euclidean time and space was the **vessel of the universe** and that a configuration of point charges would overlay space making a spacetime æther out of point charge assemblies. The really cool thing about spacetime æther assemblies is that they change size and shape according to local potential fields. Thus, spacetime æther is what implements the curvy-stretchy spacetime of Einstein.

The reasons these geometries have been so confusing to physicists and cosmologists are because of a series of incorrect decisions or forks in the road in the 1870's and circa 1900 and then a dearth of progress since the 1970's. Once science chooses the wrong fork in the road it is darn near impossible to get any new idea through the thick noggins of scientists. One of the reasons scientists made this series of mistakes is because nature is quite the trickster to overlay spacetime right on top of time and space. That means there are two geometries that we have to incorporate into our understanding. And that has been the sticking point.

As scientists collect more observations of the distant universe with the James Webb space telescope and other modern instruments, the tension in the ΛCDM cosmological model is increasing rapidly. Astronomers are seeing objects and events that should not exist according to the current ΛCDM model of the Universe. However, these observations are 100% consistent with the NPQG theory of galaxy local inflationary emission of spacetime aether and NO one time inflationary big bang. In NPQG the universe is steady state in aggregate at large scales with no known beginning nor end to time or space.

Those possible infinities in space and time emerge from the foundational elements of NPQG: Euclidean 3D space. Ample numbers of equal and opposite, charged, immutable point charges and the energy they carry.

Scientists will someday tabulate the density1 of electrinos, positrinos, and the density2 of the energy they carry in regions of space and spacetime. On very large scales, e.g., possibly superclusters, these densities should be roughly equivalent throughout the universe. Scientists will be able to calculate these densities for various objects and object structures as well.
