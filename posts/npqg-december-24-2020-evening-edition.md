_I am brainstorming ideas during NPQG Breakthrough Days. Think of ideas like vectors. Some ideas may point directly to your goal. Others may only be directionally aligned. Some may be orthogonal, such as a new line of inquiry. And of course some are heading away from the goal, but even then may spark a good idea. Enjoy_.

**Consider the gluon :**

> _A **gluon** (/ˈɡluːɒn/) is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between quarks. It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles. In layman's terms, they "glue" quarks together, forming hadrons such as protons and neutrons. In technical terms, gluons are vector gauge bosons that mediate strong interactions of quarks in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction. This is unlike the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than quantum electrodynamics (QED)._

- It seems that a gluon may not be a specific independent particle assembly, but rather a coupling of two binaries from different assemblies.

A conversation :

In 2.5 years NPQG has gotten simpler with every step forward and those steps are coming very fast now. I can explain the physical root cause of several QM concepts, including uncertainty, spin, and color charge. I can also give cogent physical explanations for formulas and ‘constants’ that aren’t constant and why, etc.

It is so much easier than scientists realize. That is what I have been saying for 2.5 years. I found a lovely garden path straight to the foundation of nature. It’s a Euclidean frame with two types of energetic point charges, that’s it. We will start teaching NPQG in pre-K some day, at least on the basic concepts level. Nursery rhymes will incorporate basic concepts of NPQG.

> _I mean Newton's Mechanics was also simple and explained a lot, until it was put to tests in extreme conditions and broke down in couple of different ways. So it is very likely that your theory is just too simple to even explain already existing experiments not to mention making predicitions. Somebody saying "it is easy and scientists don't realize it" are usually arrogant amateurs who don't even know what they are talking about properly._

Also, we can do things now like explain mass and realize that it is ‘apparent energy’ divided by local (permittivity x permeability). NPQG shows that a particle construct can have much more energy than is **apparent**, because energy can be **shielded** in whole or in part by outer binaries or rather the Euclidean world lines traced by point charges in each containment binary. So now we can deprecate the term '_mass_' if we so choose and just work with energy, which is what physicists often do, but now everyone can. I think that would be much better to teach in science classes than '_mass_', because we would have a physical explanation. '_Mass_' is apparent energy engaging with spacetime aether and pulsing gravitational '**I _was_ here and I _had_ this much energy at that time**' signals.

If I come up with mass formulas for standard model particles will that convince you? It looks like I am on the verge of that.

Dang, you are tough to convince.

Well that might take a while. But per earlier conversations here I did buy all the books, and when I run out of low hanging fruit to gather I guess I’ll start climbing that mountain too. Geesh, you would think folks would want to get in on all the discoveries. Isn’t that what scientists live for? It’s a blast. Come on in. The water is fine.

NPQG has only two free parameters. The density of the point charges in flat space. The density of energy carried by those point charges in flat space.

Now you might ask how to you calculate volumetric density in a void space with no observable reference frame? The answer is that each point charge is an Lp length ruler.

NPQG requires several adjustments to electromagnetic equations to account for the maximum electromagnetic field that implements an Lp radius sphere of immutability around each point charge, and also new formulas for permittivity and permeability as a function of local electromagnetic field strength. The latter should take care of the former.

Then there are few other implications - in particular energy shielding which we find in containment shells acting as Faraday cages, and in condensed matter culminating ultimately in a Planck core in an SMBH. I suppose there is some amount of field shielding that occurs in any situation but it may be negligible unless the local matter reaches some significant density such that Lp radius spheres are casting a noticeable shadow.

The _**only**_ fundamental quantum in the universe are geometric point charges and they are quanta of charged matter. The quantum mechanics quantum of energy is an emergent behaviour of the orbiting binary, which is itself emergent. Therefore, as a tip of the hat to the history of physics I felt it was important to keep 'quantum' in the name of my theory of everything, thus Neoclassical Physics and Quantum Gravity.
