_Here is my response._

Duality and emergence are wonderful facets of nature. I am going to make a few statements and if you suspend disbelief for a moment, they may help change your perspective on the situation. Please read this with an entirely open mind, unencumbered by the _interpretations_ of physics and cosmology. Their observations are fine.

1. I assert that there is an incredibly parsimonious formulation of nature that has been tragically missed by scientists.

3. This formulation of nature is 100% isomorphic to the standard model. less the SM'S faulty interpretations.

5. Incorrect technical assumptions in the work of Lienard and Wiechert circa 1900 have led to a complicated tree of incorrect prior interpretations which is clouding the vision of the scientists studying physics and cosmology.

7. Here are the ingredients to the Universe : Euclidean void in space and time, a density I of immutable point charges carrying a density II of energy in kinetic and electromagnetic potential form. **That's it!**

9. _But wait, how can this be?_ Unfortunately, physicists discarded point charges due to concerns over the math as idealized point charges approach infinitely closely and the math blows up with the radius in the denominator.

11. Point charges were down, but not out. They can be rehabilitated. Let's explore a natural rule that prevents any two point charges from approaching any closer then a distance near the Planck length. Also, assign the charge magnitude of |e/6| to the point charges.

13. What is the way forward? Study orbital systems of immutable point charges. Don't take my word for it. Examine the research. Can't find much? That itself is an enormous clue. Why don't we have a well established body of research for systems of orbiting point charges?

15. Imagine a nested set of binaries orbiting at vastly different radii. Start with a simple binary of two equal and oppose point charges. Imagine it has a frequency which determines its energy and its radius. Then add another binary of two point charges. And a third binary. Label the radii something well below our ability to directly observe, say r = 10\-32, 10\-28, and 10\-24 as an example. I call that the Noether core. It is what inflates, dilates, expands, contracts, and implements Einstein's spacetime throughout a passive Euclidean substrate of absolute space and time. Einstein's spacetime must be considered from this perspective of a nested tri-binary orbital structure. I called it a Noether core because it does nearly all the accounting for energy and momentum. It's also a perfect black body. I could go on.

17. Now add six weak personality point charges, one per polar vortex of each binary. Pick any combination of six weak charges. You have assembled a fermion. Six negative personality charges is an electron. You are allowed to think of the personality charge and the Noether core in terms of wave equations if you like. You can easily imagine the quarks now as having a mix of positive and negative weak personality point charges. By the way, Noether cores come in pro and anti because there are three angular momentum vectors in a Noether core and they are different magnitudes, so there are two symmetry states.
