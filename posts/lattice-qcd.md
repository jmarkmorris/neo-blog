Let's discuss Lattice QCD as presented in this PBS Space Time video.

In point charge theory, each proton is an assembly of 36 point charges, each with a specific role, energy, and path in a stable whirling assembly of point charges with a vast range of energies and radii of path curvature. It seems to me that it would be simpler than lattice QCD to finely grain simulate the continuous paths of 36 point charges through Euclidean time and space. Just guessing, but 36 \* 36 = 1296 interactions at a fine grained time scale seems fairly reasonable for **v < @** scenarios, where @ is the universal constant speed of unit potential. When point charge velocity **v > @** the behaviour is more complex due to self interaction and this adds non-trivial complexity.

In this table I've clipped various portions of Matt O'Dowd's script and then given my thoughts in response from the perspective of NPQG.

| Matt O'Dowd (speaker and script author) | The perspective from the point charge universe. |
| --- | --- |
| It's impossible to calculate perfectly the evolution of all but the most simple systems. That’s especially true when we study the quantum world, where the information density is obscenely high.      As we saw in a previous episode, it takes as many bits as there are particles in the universe to store all the information in the wavefunction of a single large molecule. | I think it is much simpler to calculate if you understand the architecture of each standard matter particle assembly.   Fermions are comprised of 12 point charges.   Each assembly has a specific structure and a role for each point charge.      From this perspective the information is quite tractable. Essentially we need to simulate the paths of a few dozen point charges as acted upon by the potential emissions of all point charges in the assembly as well as those of local spacetime assemblies. For example, each fermion has a six point charge Noether core engine, configured as three nested binaries, adorned by six lower energy personality charges. Each of the three binaries in the Noether core has an energy level, frequency, and radius of orbit. |
| Every proton and neutron is composed of 3 quarks stuck together by gluons. Well, that’s a simplification. Each nucleon is a roiling swarm of **_virtual_** quarks and gluons that _**LOOKS**_ like three quarks from the outside. The interactions of quarks via gluons is described by _quantum chromodynamics,_ i.e., _QCD_. | Nucleons (protons, neutrons) are comprised of three quarks, each with 12 point charges, for a total of 36 point charges flying around in stable patterns. The gluon as conceived by quantum theory is implemented by an interaction between binaries that causes them to interlock via swirling polar vortices of potential. |
| To test QCD, we need to figure out what the theory predicts about properties of hadrons that are actually measureable. And that’s near impossible because the force mediated by gluons is very strong - earning it the name the strong force. And that strength turns the interior of a hadron into a maelstrom of activity which at first glance looks impossible to simulate on any computer we could ever build. Or would be if it weren’t for the fact that people are exceptionally clever, and came up with _lattice simulations_. | In point charge theory we are talking about at most 36 \* 36 = 1296 point charge to point charge interactions along each charge's continuous path. With fine grained simulation of **absolute time** steps we can evaluate every action on each particle in each time step and predict the point charges path. The **absolute spatial** coordinates of the continuous point charge path is calculated at each fine grained time step to determine the initiation point of an expanding potential sphere. This is essentially a number crunching problem with the main scaling factor being the granularity of time steps. This does not appear to be especially challenging for state of the art computation. |
| Say we want to \[use QED to\] predict what happens when two electrons are shot towards each other. We can actually calculate the almost exact probability of them bouncing apart with a given speed and angle. We do that by adding up all the possible ways that interaction could happen. For example there are various ways the first electron could emit a photon which is absorbed by the second, or vice versa. Or it could happen via two electrons or more, or one of those photons could spontaneously form an electron-positron pair before becoming a photon again, and so on. | It is easy to imagine the myriad ways two electron assemblies, each with 12 swirling point charges, might collide, interact with the local Noether core based aether, and proceed through some set of interactions and reactions to produce an outcome of particles and momenta. One might imagine that the phase or orientation of the various portions of the electron assemblies might influence the probability of outcome.      With point charge simulation, it will be possible to use Monte-Carlo scenarios to emulate the expected probabilities and outcomes. We can then compare these to observations. The depth and extent of the Monte-Carlo scenario space will influence the accuracy of the simulation for the less common scenarios.      We can use these same techniques whether we are looking in the QED domain or the QCD domain. It really doesn't matter that some forces are much larger than others as long as we can accurately keep track of all the numerical precision. Simulation optimization techniques replace renormalization. For example, perhaps we might find that the discrete time steps of the simulation can be longer for slower moving particles. |
| Each family of interaction types is represented by a Feynman diagram, and quantum electrodynamics gives us a recipe book for adding up the probabilities. | Each scenario is represented by a Feynman diagram, but we can do even better — we can track the provenance and path of every point charge that is involved!!! |
| Real particles are sustained oscillations in a quantum field that have real energy and consistent properties. Virtual particles are just a handy calculation tool - a way of representing something deeper. They represent the transient disturbances in quantum fields due to the presence of real particles that couple to those fields. | Standard matter particles are assemblies of unit potential point charges. That's it. Each point charge is constantly emitting a stream of Dirac sphere potential waves. Each point charge is constantly reacting to all impinging Dirac sphere potential waves. That's it. We don't need virtual particles to model nature.      Since each standard matter particle has a specific assembly formulation, the pattern that assembly makes in the single universe wide potential field is what the quantum sciences study. They have not yet realized that these patterns are created by field generators, i.e., unit potential point charges. |
| The strong nuclear force, the coupling between quark and gluon fields is so intense that the disturbances of those fields are way too tumultuous to be easily approximated by virtual particles. Lattice QCD is an effort to model how the quantum fields evolve over the course of a strong force interaction. To do this you need to account for all possible paths between the starting and final field configuration to get the probability of that transition happening.      _\[omitted discussion of irrelevant details of Lattice QCD\]_ | We can simulate the paths of the unit potential point charges directly and from that calculate the potential field and its gradients throughout absolute time and space. In reality we only need to calculate the potential field at the instantaneous locations of each point charge.      I don't see a need for Lattice QCD in NPQG. |
| Before Richard Feynman came up with his famous diagrams, he devised a way to calculate quantum probabilities called the Feynman path integral. It calculates the probability that a particle will move from one location to another by adding up the probabilities of all possible paths between those points. Actually, it also includes the impossible paths, but no time to explain that now. Every time you add the probability for a single Feynman diagram you’re actually adding infinite possible trajectories using Feynman path integrals. | Feynman was working with assemblies of point particles, not understanding that standard model particles are not actually point particles.      With Monte-Carlo simulation of point charge paths we will have a simple method to determine outcome probabilities and configurations. We can know quite precisely, including the provenance of each point charge!      I don't see a need for Feynman path integrals in NPQG. |
| Our quantum field is a 3-D pixelated lattice that evolves through time. Each time step results a complex-valued phase shift at each spatial point. Those complex numbers are very difficult to deal with in Monte Carlo approaches. So we need to pretend that time is just another dimension of space. This operation is called the _Wick rotation_ and it eliminates the complex nature of the phase shifts. If we also “pixelate” the time dimension then we have a lattice with 4 spatial dimensions. | The reason that time and space are so closely related is that each and every Dirac sphere that acts upon a point charge was emitted at some absolute time and space location (t, x, y, z) and expanded spherically at a universal constant field speed of @. So yes, time and space are directly related through this mechanism. If I give you the Dirac sphere stream characteristics at t', x', y', z' it is possible to calculate the emission point t, x, y, z. After all, we know that (x'-x)2 + (y' -y)2 + (x' - x)2 = @(t' - t)2. Individual Dirac sphere stream characteristics at any point in time and space include the scalar electric potential and its gradient. |

The direct simulation of point charge paths and potential emissions in assemblies will be a far superior method to both Lattice QCD and Feynman path integrals which will, in my view, be obsoleted in the new point charge era.
