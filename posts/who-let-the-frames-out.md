Science history is chock full of small to medium wrong turns and corrections. Occasionally science goes off track on a long bender. In such cases, we call the course correction a **paradigm shift**. This episode of PBS Space Time covers a topic at the heart of all theories of nature — their space and time transformation geometries required to get our bearings between reference frames. Thankfully, there is a new big dog in reference frames — **the absolute frame**.

This 2015 episode by host Matt O'Dowd contains the solution to the universe yet requires a transformer toy re-arrangement to solve 150 years of mixup and confusion. Classic first line : "_Does the speed of light actually have anything to do, … with light?!_" No it has everything to do with the speed of the electric potential, which is what Matt says. A key point Matt makes is that the speed of causality determines the speed of light, i.e., photons. Now, as you will see, I think this concept of the speed of the electric potential being the speed of causality is somewhat flawed. Sure action occurs due to the potential emission fields which expand spherically at v = @, but what has been missed is that point potentials can travel at speeds v > @, under certain conditions.

This begs the question of why is what Matt calls the speed of causality the same as the speed of light? These are my ideas :

- _A point potential assembly emerges that we call the photon_,

- _Electric potential fields emitted by point potentials travel at velocity v = @,_

- _The photon "surfs" it's own potential field, slowing in the vicinity of high mass-energy density_,

- _The photon velocity approaches v = @ as a group._

- _Point potentials themselves can take on velocities v > @._

- _Needless to say, this throws the whole discussion of causality for a loop._

Here are swaths from the transcript, with commentary.

Matt cleverly asks why photon velocity is fixed. It is very difficult to observe any action faster than the speed of the electromagnetic field, considering we are observing with photons and we are talking about point potentials which can exceed their own field speed. Is it possible that the degree of freedom for point potentials to exceed the speed of electromagnetic field is essential to structure assembly and selection?

- It turns out that Galileo was wrong.

- Absolute velocity really does matter.

- The absolute velocity of a point potential influences the geometry of it's electric potential emissions stream.

- The absolute velocity of a point potential influences the action upon it from each coincident electric potential sphere and their gradients.

- When v=0 it is a special connection to Euclidean time and space as the point potential path is fixed in space.

And there's this sense that physics might be done, except there are hints of something horribly wrong lurking in the math. The first clues to the bizarre quantum nature of reality had emerged.

In fact, we now know that even Newton's mechanics were using assumptions that implied an infinite speed of light, which is really bad. It would imply that space and time and matter don't exist._

The Liénard Wiechert potentials are described as emanating from point potentials. I am proposing that if we **SPLIT THE QUANTUM** into equal and opposite point potentials emitting Dirac sphere potentials that everything will be much more understandable. Your math will still work. Your observations will stand. However, there is much to be learned from the nature of point potentials.

Once we split the quantum, now you can start thinking about velocity of the point potentials above or below the speed of the potential emissions. There does not appear to be a fundamental law that individual point potentials have a velocity limit.

I don't see anything in Maxwell's equations that discusses point potentials with velocity v > @ where @ is the speed of the electromagnetic potential. Just think about that for a moment. Imagine you are driving and a potential field is emanating from your car at 1 mph or 1 kph. Of course you can pass that potential field. You can drive all around on highways and side-streets and create a history that may or may not wash over you at some point. It's weird to think about and we can't just schmear it over as a field. Doing so loses information.

I'm going to skip over the comments on mass because mass is poorly understood by science. Mass is merely a proxy for apparent energy. We have to consider mass in the context of point potential structures. Point charge structures come in a variety of forms, including the photon which appears massless, as well as the neutrino which has an oscillating mass. Suffice it to say that these are all easy to explain from the perspective of point potential structures.

The Galilean transformation imagines nature and the universe as being built upon Euclidean space and time. This was directionally on track, but largely because science hadn't truly reached the technology level to investigate space and time at incredibly small and extremely high energy scales.

The Lorentz transformation was an advancement in effective theory, because it successfully modeled spacetime at scale. However, the **ontological error** is that the Lorentzian behaviour actually has a root cause. It's not just an abstract geometry. Lorentzian behaviour is a result of everything observable being based upon Noether cores (nested tri-binaries). Since we, our instruments, photons, everything else, including spacetime aether are based on Noether cores, our perspective is distorted.

Yet it goes even deeper. Noether cores are a simple embodiment of point potential behaviour. So even in high energy reactions where Noether core binaries might decay, nothing has really changed — nature is simply point potentials responding to coincident fields from all other point potentials, and in some cases, themselves.

Let's take a brief look at the major reference frame transformation concepts and then try to build a primitive taxonomy table.

> _In physics, a Galilean transformation is used to transform between the coordinates of two reference frames which **differ only by constant relative motion** within the constructs of Newtonian physics. These transformations together with spatial rotations and translations in space and time form the inhomogeneous Galilean group. Without the translations in space and time the group is the homogeneous Galilean group. The Galilean group is the group of motions of Galilean relativity acting on the four dimensions of space and time, forming the Galilean geometry. This is the passive transformation point of view._
> 
> _In special relativity the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Galilean transformations are, respectively, replaced by the Lorentz transformations and Poincaré transformations; conversely, the group contraction in the classical limit c → ∞ of Poincaré transformations yields Galilean transformations._

Lorentz transformations in special relativity take advantage of the fact that there is no acceleration. Thus length contraction is in only one dimension. That is why v, aka s', is considered only one parameter, rather than three, i.e. x', y', z'. Also, it seems intuitive to me that there should be an upper limit to the Lorentz factor based on the Planck frequency, but I haven't seen a treatment on that.

> _The Poincaré group, named after Henri Poincaré (1906), was first defined by Hermann Minkowski as the group of Minkowski spacetime isometries. It is a ten-dimensional non-abelian Lie group that is of importance as a model in our understanding the most basic fundamentals of physics._
> 
> _A Minkowski spacetime isometry has the property that the interval between events is left invariant. For example, if everything were postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stop-watch you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything were shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the proper length of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group._

This makes it self-referential and again requires nothing of Euclidean time and space.      What we might think of as moving in spacetime is really moving in relation to the r = 0 potential or self.now coordinates. This means there is such a thing as v=0 in absolution time and space.      This means that some things are not just relativity. The absolute velocity of an object is a factor. |

How did we get here? In the 1920's, quantum mechanics slammed on the brakes, screeched to a halt, and pulled up short of the goal. They detected the quantum of energy, implemented by the frequency of two opposite point potentials orbiting each other. How is it possible they missed that the real quantum is the point potential, the unit positive and negative potentials? Think about that. Science racing towards the root cause of nature and the search screeches to a halt on a behaviour that we now know is caused by a pair of point potentials. It turns out it took a century to discover the true quantum is defined by individual point potentials.

Once the true basis of nature is understood as individual point potentials it becomes clear that the absolute frame of references, Euclidean time and space, is the proper frame of nature. Sure, we can overlay other frames in cases where transformations aid the science, but in all cases those should be expressible as transformations from the absolute frame. It truly matters because describing point potential behaviour, especially in point potential assemblies, is the reason these other reference frames are of interest.

A more esoteric, yet relevant transformation is the AdS-CFT correspondence.

> _In theoretical physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, is a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On the other side of the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles._

> 
> _It also provides a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of the usefulness of the duality results from the fact that it is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory._

This is a tragedy-comedy. In hindsight one might have said, hold on a second, if both your classes of extremely complicated theories map to each other, does that provide a clue that there may be a simple geometry that also maps to both of them? Hindsight is 20-20.

Let's **_SPLIT THE QUANTUM_** and consider the universe from the perspective of the positive and negative unit potential Dirac deltas emitting Dirac sphere potentials. It is much easier to contemplate emergence and selection from the Euclidean perspective of absolute relativity.
