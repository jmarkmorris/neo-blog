In Robert Dicke's 1957 paper, "Gravitation without a Principle of Equivalence" he writes of the requirements for a new theory of gravitation.

The Noether core implements the strong force and Lorentz invariance. This is accomplished with six point charges. The geometry is based upon orbiting negative and positive point charges. The orbiting binary has fascinating properties depending on energy that determine the orbital radius, frequency, and velocity of the two point charges. Nature cleverly nests point charge binaries to three levels, each at vastly different scales of energy. This Noether core assembly is like a self-balancing gyroscopic flywheel of energy and momentum. This satisfies Dicke's first requirement.

NPQG overachieves on the second requirement by reducing all the particles and tunables in modern physics and cosmology down to a Euclidean void in time and space populated with energetic point potentials of magnitude |e/6|. There are three known parameters and they are all empirically measurable.

1. The speed of the spherically expanding potential wave emitting from each point charge at each continuous moment in absolute time. I give this the symbol @. The photon assembly sails on its own potential fields, and thus the photon speed c, approaches @ as the energy in the spacetime aether decreases towards zero.

3. The large scale average density of point charges.

5. The large scale average energy density carried by point charges.

Note that the dynamical geometry of the binary itself guarantees a lower bound orbital radius. I wrote about that here: [The Binary Curvature Limit Matches the PlanckÂ Scale](https://johnmarkmorris.com/2022/08/12/the-binary-curvature-limit-is-the-anchor-to-planck-scale/). This minimal radius gives a physical implementation to several Planck constants, such as the Planck length, Planck frequency, and Planck energy. With these theoretical yet physical metrics we can now define measures of space and time in these multiples. Thus, we are able to establish measures of volumetric densities of point charges and energy carried by point charges. This is wonderful because it all emerges directly from first principles.

On Dicke's third requirement, we must restate Mach's principle for the point charge universe. Specifically point charges move along a path in R4 Euclidean time and space and continuously emit a spherically expanding potential wave. The shape of that potential wave stream is influenced by the emitting point charge velocity. As each point charge moves along its continuous path, at each moment it is acted upon by all intersecting spherical potential streams. Action is a function of the particle's path and each incoming potential stream, which we can then sum to a net action that determines the instantaneous forward path.
