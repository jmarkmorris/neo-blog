For the last few days I have been working on drawings and illustrations for the point charge structure of the standard model particles. It is going well. Visual representations will be helpful in telling the story and teaching NPQG. Here are various attempts at visuals.

In the lower right corner, the dot diagrams show point charges at different orbital radii making up a structure. That diagram could an interesting step towards diagramming reactions like chemistry or perhaps even a link to Feynman diagrams. It would be awesome if the map from point charges structure to the syntax and semantics of Feynman diagrams could be revealed.

I also mapped out the point charge structure of the fermions. The energy cores shown in the diagram are nested binaries with vastly different energy.

The energy cores that power fermions have wonderful characteristics. It feels right that an electron would have one core and a proton would have three cores, one from each quark. The stacked point charge graphic for the electron and proton will have shapes similar to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from SpaceX.

In the maelstrom of bangs and other high energy events it may be the case that :

1. Very high energy binaries are formed.

3. Medium energy binaries capture higher energy Gen I binaries to form Gen II Noether cores.

5. Low energy electron binaries encapsulate medium energy Gen II binaries to form Gen III Noether cores.

7. A charged mix of six personality point charges are coupled to the Noether core.
    1. electron : Noether core + electron personality.
    
    3. positron : Anti Noether core + positron personality.
    
    5. quark and antiquark : Noether core powering a fractional charge personality

When a neutral 3:3 personality couples with a Noether core that is a neutrino. As free particles the neutrinos have low apparent energy and have oscillating energy shielding. We can probably chalk this up to neutrino's being fairly easy to make and generation I being very stable, even if it does wobble. So in the nuclear reactions within our Sun, for example, relatively low apparent energy neutrinos are created.

A pro and anti core form the photon assembly.

- Do photons have a handedness?

- Is handedness related to orbital direction in nested orbits?

- Does a photon take on a planar geometry and travel perpendicular to the plane?

- Do orbits counter-rotate?

- Does the photon contain multi-particle orbits?

> _Photon polarization is the quantum mechanical description of the classical polarized sinusoidal plane electromagnetic wave. An individual photon can be described as having right or left circular polarization, or a superposition of the two. Equivalently, a photon can be described as having horizontal or vertical linear polarization, or a superposition of the two._

We need to link up our emerging understanding of photon point charge geometry to the state of the art science. From the quote about photon polarization it appears to be a straightforward mapping. We also have quite a bit of flexibility in our architecture should the sleuthing prove challenging.

- Six electrinos,

- Six positrinos,

- Two possible orbital directions for each point charge,

- Position of each point charge around its orbit (wave equation),

- Energies of each point charge,

- Orbital locking,

- Orbital separation in the line of travel,

Who knows, maybe the configuration is similar to the exploded view! It looks like that first energetic binary would do a good job clearing spacetime aether out of the way. How about something that is steered like wind art by the energy and energy gradient of spacetime aether?

While aether is so very lightly interacting at low and medium energy we know that the electromagnetic energy and energy gradient of the aether introduce local speed limits based on permittivity and permeability. We'll _measure_ that we are still going the same speed as we were, but '_aether distance_' and '_aether time_' will adjust to fool us. Lots to imagine going forward.

The source of the photon — the reaction — can provide clues. However spacetime aether is configured, reactions must have a ready source of 6/6 photon shells on which to shed energy and **_zip_** — off they go! Maybe at the energy level of spacetime aether, old and tired neutrinos and antineutrinos can finally snuggle without reacting. Imagine that, two elderly structures, a neutrino and antineutrino just barely hanging on to their stability in perpetuity thanks to the sufficient densities of point charges and energy in the universe. Thankfully our elderly duo of neutrinos is suddenly rejuvenated by a major transfusion of energy and they reconfigure into the photon configuration, off they go ~ zing ~ warp speed away. Imagination is a wonderful thing.

N.B. Had the density of energy and point charges been two low in combination, the old neutrinos might cool enough to lose their structure. In such a universe there would be no light. Reactions would be unable to shed energy. There are many interesting angles like this for scientists to research in the NPQG era.

Emergence in the universe is dependent upon cycles upon cycles of reactions under different conditions — a phase diagram with many higher order dimensions. Given NPQG enabled research institutions and investment, then within a decade, and perhaps sooner, we will be able to model and simulate any conditions we desire. Imagine what we will discover to be possible under conditions that are achievable with rapidly advancing technology.

Suffice it to say, safe clean, and compact energy generators that operate with low cost, clean fuel will happen and it won't take twenty years. It will be possible to build and operate such a generator with no more risk than a normal factory.

Soon, I hope, physicists and mathematicians will scramble to integrate at least four different mathematical physics systems with NPQG and enhance their own models as well. In addition to those efforts, entirely new native techniques will pop up like mushrooms from universities, industry, and in both proprietary and open source software.

I recommend that universities and industry cooperate to create and manage an organized, structured, reusable knowledge base covering the main trunk and branches of the NPQG knowledge tree. I define knowledge broadly, i.e., the source code of nature and the universe. Adopt the model of professional open source and GitHub for developing the core NPQG knowledge. There will be many contributors and the knowledge will be broad, and deep, and will evolve quickly. Let's try to maximize leverage and reuse!
