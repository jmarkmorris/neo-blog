Let's discuss the NPQG model for how point charges and emergence create **the Four Forces**. The four forces emerge from the action that occurs when emitted electric potential intersects with point charges. Perhaps more importantly, each of the four forces refers to particular operational aspects of particle assemblies.

**THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE**

All particle assemblies are continuously and losslessly exchanging energy with neighbor assemblies. Frequently, the neighbors are spacetime æther particles. When standard matter exchanges energy with æther we call that the apparent energy (mass) of standard matter. Mass is based on the root-mean-squared (RMS) outstanding energy. Mass is the ante that standard matter pays to the aether. When standard matter provides mass energy to the æther, it excites the æther, and the resulting energy gradient implements gravity. The gravitational energy wave falls off with the square of the distance, 1/r2.

**The gravitational force operates similar to convection**.

**THE WEAK FORCE**

The weak force is primarily implemented in reactions by the personality charges of fermions along with leveraging nearby low energy spacetime aether structures to transfer and rearrange energy and point charges between the inputs and products of the reaction. Spacetime aether particles may be Higgs clusters along with ultimately redshifted neutrinos and photons which themselves are neutral particles. The weak force also involves the W and Z bosons which are an intermediate structure in a reaction aided by spacetime aether Higgs assemblies. The weak force merges with the electromagnetic force at high energy.

**THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE**

Scientists claim that the electromagnetic force is implemented by the photon and acts on electric charge at the scales of atoms and molecules, i.e., electrons and protons. However, at the level of point charges, all forces are implemented with the action between point charges and emitted potential.

**THE STRONG FORCE**

The strong force is found in the Noether core tri-binaries of each standard matter particle assembly. Binaries have potential vortices and pairs of binaries bond or couple via these vortices. Physicists call the coupling the gluon.

The strong force is used for two separate but related purposes. First to hold **nucleons** together. Second to hold **nuclei** together.

**UNIFICATION OF THE FOUR FORCES**

Photons have a 6ε⊖/6ε⊕ composition of electrinos and positrinos and have a wide variety of energies and always travel at c relative to the spacetime aether. When neutrinos and photons ultimately redshift away much of their energy they may join other particles in the æther, with a black body radiation of 2.7 Kelvin. The force unification chart shows gravity beginning near 10\-32 Kelvin and 10\-43 seconds. This may be the time frame where Higgs assemblies are produced. Higgs present virtually no apparent energy and therefore are extremely difficult to observe. Ultimately all forces merge to electric potential action in a Planck point charge core.
